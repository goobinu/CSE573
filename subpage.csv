Ethan Mollick,https://www.linkedin.com/in/emollick?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"In our new paper we ran an experiment at Procter and Gamble with 776 experienced professionals solving real business problems.

We found that individuals randomly assiged to use AI did as well as a team of two without AI. And AI-augmented teams produced more exceptional solutions. The teams using AI were happier as well.

Even more interesting: AI broke down professional silos. R&D people with AI produced more commercial work and commercial people with AI had more technical solutions.

The standard model of ""AI as productivity tool"" may be too limiting. Today’s AI can function as a kind of teammate, offering better performance, expertise sharing, and even positive emotional experiences.

Panagiotis Kriaris,https://at.linkedin.com/in/pkriaris?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"GenAI is easy to start but hard to scale. Too many companies are stuck in endless pilots. Here’s what it takes to build GenAI capability.

McKinsey has recently published their findings from working with 150+ companies on their GenAI programs over two years.

Two hurdles stand out:

𝟭. 𝗙𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗲: Teams waste time on duplicate experiments, wait on compliance processes, and solve problems that don’t matter. 30% - 50% of innovation time is spent trying to meet compliance - not building.

𝟮. 𝗙𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲: Even when a prototype works, most companies can’t get it into production. Risk, security, and cost barriers overwhelm teams, leading to stalled or cancelled deployments.

According to McKinsey the most successful GenAI platforms contains three core components:

𝟭. 𝗔 𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗹:
To support both innovation and scale, companies need a secure, centralized portal that gives teams easy access to pre-approved gen AI tools, services, and documentation. It should enable developers to quickly build with reusable patterns, while also offering governance features like observability, cost controls, and access management. The best portals promote contribution and reuse across the organization, reducing friction and accelerating development at scale.

𝟮.𝗔𝗻 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗿𝗲𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝗔𝗜 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀:
Scaling GenAI requires modular, open architecture that enables teams to reuse services, application patterns, and data products across use cases. Leading companies build libraries of common components (like RAG, embeddings, or chat workflows) and focus on integration via APIs - not vendor lock-in. Infrastructure and policy as code ensure changes can propagate quickly and securely across the platform, reducing cost and accelerating deployment.

𝟯. 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱, 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗔𝗜 𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀:
To scale safely, GenAI platforms must embed automated governance that enforces compliance, manages risk, and tracks costs. This includes microservices that audit prompts, detect policy violations (like sharing sensitive personal data or generating inaccurate responses), and attribute usage to specific teams. A centralized AI gateway enforces access controls, logs interactions, and routes traffic through security filters - allowing flexibility where needed. These guardrails accelerate approval processes, reduce setup time, and let teams focus on building value - not managing risk manually.

Usman Sheikh,https://ae.linkedin.com/in/usmans?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"The Enterprise AI war is not about intelligence.

It's about integration.

""First agent to connect to all of your work apps—so it can access information and complete tasks across all of them—will probably win."" David Sack

Many are underestimating how quickly we get there.

Today's landscape is fragmented:
→ 400+ hours/year lost to context switching
→ Knowledge trapped in dozens of siloed systems
→ Data ""hot"" for days, rarely accessed again
→ Valuable insights buried in unused documents

The agent that solves integration unlocks:
→ Information flowing effortlessly across systems
→ Automated workflows (legal, marketing, procurement)
→ Persistent context, independent of apps
→ A single, seamless interface replacing dozens of UIs

Current roadblocks for agents:
→ Messy data, not integration-ready
→ Cross-system authentication hurdles
→ Security policies blocking access
→ Difficulty maintaining cross-app context

What we can possibly do in the near future:
→ Inbox managed entirely by personalized AI assistant
→ Proactive alerts predicting issues before they arise
→ Proposals instantly tailored from previous interactions
→ Self-updating documentation as processes evolve

AI capabilities are exponentially growing:
→ AI model capabilities double every 7 months
→ 2019: seconds of task-handling capacity
→ Today: hour-long tasks handled in minutes
→ 2026: day-long tasks executed in hours
→ 2030: month-long projects completed in days

This isn't just about connecting apps.

Just like cloud transformed digital infrastructure, AI agents will redefine organizational intelligence.

Companies that master integration won't just become more efficient, they'll set a completely new baseline.

This will make traditional workflows look as obsolete as fax machines and filing cabinets."
Henry Shi,https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrythe9th?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"We Tried Replacing 1000 Human Jobs with AI

The results were shocking—and not for the reasons you’d think. Here's what happened when we tried replacing 1000 freelancers with AI... 🧵

How close are we to Economic AGI? Despite all the recent talk and hype around AGI, nobody has a clue or benchmark.

I previously built a $1B+/yr marketplace, and so I wanted to know: What % of human jobs on UpWork & Freelancer .com could be solved using AI today? That’s our proxy for an Economic AGI benchmark.

Ryan Brandt and I scraped over 1,000 latest job postings and used the latest AI models (o1, Claude, Gemini) and agents/tools (Windsurf, Axiom, etc.) to apply for jobs and attempt to complete tasks.

The results? AI could solve ~15% of tasks…but we made exactly $0. Here’s what we learned—and what this means for the future of work:👇

1️⃣ ~5% of jobs: AI could solve these in 1 shot (e.g., logo design, content writing, simple scripts) by simply pasting the request into ChatGPT
Example: Someone offered $750 to update a simple logo. Another paid $20/hr to convert text PDFs to Word. Many clients were simply unaware of any AI tools 🤯

2️⃣ ~10% of jobs: AI could solve these with agents/tools (e.g., storefronts, web scraping, browser automation).
🛠️ But the agent/tooling space is messy & unreliable. People just wanted to pay for working solutions.

3️⃣ ~5% of jobs were ironically about clients delegating AI tasks to humans. (eg, use AI voice generation tools to make a voiceover)
Clients want humans to ""deal with it"" rather than wrestling with agents themselves.

4️⃣ Most job descriptions themselves were detailed and well-written prompts, which we could directly just paste into ChatGPT!

So Why Did We Earn $0?
Even with AI’s power:
- Pay-to-play: Workers must pay to apply to jobs. Each bid alone cost $1+ just to apply
- Crowded market: Jobs attract 20+ bids, often from workers with thousands of 5 star reviews and decades of project experience
- Broken UX: Platforms aren’t built for AI-driven work

We applied to ~30 jobs (max limit on our plan), priced in the bottom 10th percentile, and shared full AI solutions upfront in 50% of bids.
Results:
- Less than 1/2 of bids were even opened
- Only 6 clients replied
- After multiple of back-and-forth clarifications and rework, we never got paid
- Net loss: $100 in credits + API fees

Lessons Learned
1️⃣ AI is here—but adoption is slow. People are stuck in old ways.
2️⃣ The AI tools/agents market is a mess. People want solutions, not more tools.
3️⃣ Traditional marketplaces aren't built for the AI economy. UpWork/Freelancer have absolute terrible UX for both sides:

I’ve built a $1B+ marketplace at Super.com and am deeply passionate about this space.
If you’re building in AI, Agents, or thinking about the future economic engine and AGI, I’d love to chat, help ideate and angel invest.

If this resonated: like, share, follow or tag someone building in this space.

What do you think the future of AI Agents and Work looks like? 👇"
Greg Meyers,https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-meyers-cio?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"40% more drugs at 60% of the cost - that's what serious investors in pharmaceutical companies believe AI can deliver for our industry. But how do we get there? 

This week, at our Business Insights & Technology (BI&T) Quarterly Town Hall, we explored three critical questions: What's driving the AI frenzy in life sciences? What have we learned from our own three-year journey? And how must our profession evolve to stay relevant?

We broke the conversation into three parts:

1. Why so much energy around AI in life sciences? 

The transformation is already underway: faster discovery of targets, more efficient clinical trials, higher reliability in manufacturing, and better patient engagement. Analysts forecast that AI could enable 40% more drugs at 60% of the cost - and so while pilots and proof of concepts are useful, they are singles and doubles in a game where home runs are expected

2. What actually moves the needle - lessons from three years in. Our AI journey has taught us what works:

- Layer AI onto reimagined processes, not old ones
- Lead with product to build ""AI-powered race cars,"" not faster horses
- Connect top-down vision with bottom-up needs - workforce productivity and enterprise transformation will not align spontaneously; we must be a cause in the matter of aligning it
- Keep decision-making teams small and focused (see: the Ringelmann effect - too many cooks spoil the broth)

3. Reinventing IT in the age of AI. Every decade, enterprise technology must reinvent itself. This is one of those moments. The shifts ahead include:

- From translators → product leaders (as business users gain AI tools to build directly)
- From consumers → creators of advantage (extending technology uniquely rather than just buying what's off the shelf)
- From fragmented processes run by people → enablers of self-improving processes (AI-native by default)
- From change as a project → change as a daily capability

For decades, IT organizations had two things: scale and skill. We were an internal monopoly. In the era of vibe coding, this monopoly is coming to an end. We have to lead, not gatekeep.

The future won't wait. As AI democratizes technology, IT functions must choose: be reactive and widen the gap, or be proactive and narrow the gap. 

At BMS, we're committed to the latter by: 
1) Equipping our workforce with state-of-the-art AI tools to allow them to self-explore,
2) Empowering and upskilling our workforce through AI literacy programs which tens of thousands of employees have already completed, and 
3) Concentrating efforts on functional applications of AI that can make a material difference to the company.

We stand at a unique intersection: the opportunity to do the most meaningful work of our careers while defining what the future of our profession will be."
"Sol Rashidi, MBA",https://www.linkedin.com/in/sol-rashidi-mba-a672291?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"The AI gave a clear diagnosis. The doctor trusted it. 
The only problem? The AI was wrong.

A year ago, I was called in to consult for a global healthcare company.

They had implemented an AI diagnostic system to help doctors analyze thousands of patient records rapidly. The promise? Faster disease detection, better healthcare.

Then came the wake-up call.

The AI flagged a case with a high probability of a rare autoimmune disorder. The doctor, trusting the system, recommended an aggressive treatment plan.

But something felt off.

When I was brought in to review, we discovered the AI had misinterpreted an MRI anomaly. The patient had an entirely different condition—one that didn’t require aggressive treatment. A near-miss that could have had serious consequences.

As AI becomes more integrated into decision-making, here are three critical principles for responsible implementation:

- Set Clear Boundaries

Define where AI assistance ends and human decision-making begins. Establish accountability protocols to avoid blind trust.


- Build Trust Gradually

Start with low-risk implementations. Validate critical AI outputs with human intervention. Track and learn from every near-miss.


- Keep Human Oversight

AI should support experts, not replace them. Regular audits and feedback loops strengthen both efficiency and safety.

At the end of the day, it’s not about choosing AI 𝘰𝘳 human expertise.
It’s about building systems where both work together—responsibly.

💬 What’s your take on AI accountability? How are you building trust in it?"
Aishwarya Srinivasan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/aishwarya-srinivasan?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"A lot of folks have been asking me: “How do I upskill into AI if I’m coming from a data analyst background?”

To make it easier, I’ve put together a 6-month roadmap that walks you through the skills, projects, and milestones you can follow to make that transition.

It covers:
→ Foundation building with Python + stats
→ Machine learning fundamentals (supervised + unsupervised)
→ Evaluation mastery
→ LLM workflows for analysts
→ MLOps awareness
→ And finally, polishing a portfolio that will actually get you noticed

Now, here’s my two cents on how to use this roadmap:
→ Don’t rush it. Take each month as a sprint, and focus on building portfolio artifacts along the way.
→ Share your progress online. The projects you showcase will open doors faster than just listing skills.
→ Use this as a guideline, not gospel. Everyone learns differently, adapt it to your pace and interests.

"Peter Slattery, PhD",https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterslattery1?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"""As agents become more capable and widespread, so do their risks. They can amplify threats that cross national borders, such as interference in elections or disruptions to critical infrastructure, and exacerbate human rights concerns, from privacy violations to limits on free expression. Addressing these challenges requires more than national regulation. It requires global governance.

This paper examines how these potential risks can be managed through foundational global governance tools that are non-AI-specific in nature and universal in scope: international law, non-binding global norms, and global accountability mechanisms. We explore how these can be used, where they fall short, and what must change to strengthen them.

Key Takeaways

▪️Existing international obligations matter. Governments must respect sovereignty, prevent cross-border harms, and protect human rights when using or regulating AI agents.

▪️Companies are part of the equation. While not directly bound by international law, firms benefit from aligning with global standards and calling out unlawful state behavior.

▪️Global accountability channels exist. International institutions, particularly the UN system, provide avenues for oversight and redress, alongside other legal and normative mechanisms
Important gaps remain. Weak enforcement, unclear liability, and conflicting domestic frameworks risk undermining global governance.

Why It Matters

▪️For governments: Upholding international law will be central to stability and cooperation as AI agents spread.

▪️For companies: Respecting global rules strengthens trust with users, investors, and regulators.

▪️For civil society and individuals: Demanding accountability ensures AI development serves the public interest.""

Olivia Moore,https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliviamoore94?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Generative AI has spawned thousands of new products. But outside of ChatGPT, what are everyday consumers using? What's growing, and what has flattened?

I crunched the numbers to find the top 50 consumer AI web products by monthly global visits - here's my learnings: 

1. Most leading products are built from the “ground up” around generative AI - of the 50 on the list, 80% are brand new as of the past year. Only five are owned by big tech companies (ex. Google, Microsoft), and of the remaining 45, nearly half are bootstrapped!

2. ChatGPT has a massive lead, for now…representing 60% of traffic to the entire list! Character.AI comes in at #2, with ~21% of ChatGPT's traffic. Compared to mainstream consumer products, even the top AI products are fairly small - ChatGPT ranks around the same traffic scale as Reddit, LinkedIn, and Twitch, but far behind Facebook and Instagram. 

3. General assistants (ex. ChatGPT, Bard, Poe) represent almost 70% of traffic, but companionship (ex. Character.AI) and content generation (ex. Midjourney, ElevenLabs) are surging! Model hubs are also a category to watch, with only two companies on the list (Civitai, Hugging Face) but both in the top 10. 

4. While some early winners have emerged, most categories are still up for grabs - with a <2x gap in traffic between the #1 and the #2 leading players. Use case or workflow-specific platforms are also emerging alongside more horizontal players - ex. Leonardo Ai has taken off in image generation for games assets, while Midjourney continues growing as the leading generalist platform. 

5. Acquisition for top products is almost all organic - with the median gen AI company on the list seeing 99% free acquisition! This compares to 52% for the median consumer subscription company before AI. 

Consumers are also showing significant willingness to pay for genAI, with 90% of products monetizing, and at a ~2x higher ARPU than non-AI consumer subscription comparables. 

6. Mobile is still emerging as a platform for AI products - only 15 companies on the list have an app, and just three (PhotoRoom, Speechify, Character.AI) saw >10% of traffic from their app versus website. Given consumers now spend 36 more minutes per day on mobile than desktop, we're excited to see more app-first AI products emerge soon.

Bobby Guelich,https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobby-guelich?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Today's deep dive: AI Clinical Summarization tools 🕵️♀️📚

One of the areas gen AI has immense potential in healthcare is its ability to surface and synthesize information from vast sets of unstructured documents and data.

As Oscar Health cofounder Mario Schlosser puts it: “[LLMs] are uniquely capable at going from unstructured data into structured data, and the other direction.”

So it’s no surprise that distilling information from a wide range of clinical documents and data is one of the most common applications of AI that we’re seeing come to market.

There are MANY use cases for summarization across nearly every dimension of healthcare. To name a few:

↳ Pre-charting
↳ Referral summaries
↳ Discharge summaries
↳ Diagnosis and care gap identification
↳ Quality measurement and improvement
↳ Real world evidence curation
↳ Clinical trial matching
↳ Clinical registry submissions
↳ Clinical documentation improvement (CDI)
↳ Prior authorizations
↳ Legal and insurance use cases – e.g., workers comp, life insurance

Despite their broad applicability, uptake of these solutions has been relatively slow, at least in comparison to ambient scribing solutions.

A big reason is their perceived risk. With summarization, the AI is making a subjective call about what to include and what to leave out. There's also the potential it hallucinates something not present in the underlying information set. In a clinical context, both are major concerns.

Still, between advancements in gen AI capabilities and improvements in risk mitigation techniques, we're seeing more and more organizations begin to evaluate and adopt summarization products, starting with lower risk use cases.

Will be interesting to watch this space in the coming months to see how quickly the pace picks up, particularly for clinical use cases.

Curious to hear what are others seeing.

Raghvender Arni,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rarni?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Happy New Year! If you are an Enterprise CTO, you are probably thinking about your GenAI strategy. Here's a decent write-up by Gartner: https://gtnr.it/3RQodsK.

To augment that, here are some #genai trends to track and act on in 2024:

--Open and Smaller Models: Open models like Llama, Mistral, BERT, and FLAN are becoming competitive with larger, closed-source models. They're suitable for many use cases and offer transparency for Responsible AI. In my opinion, open & closed models are not in a zero-sum game; BOTH should be used for the right use case.
Action: Implement a clear plan for using different models. Amazon Web Services (AWS) users can leverage Bedrock & SageMaker (https://bit.ly/3vkX4qa).

-- Domain-Adapted Models: Use your enterprise proprietary data to extend a large language model via continued pre-training (CPT) for domain-specific tasks.
Action: Assess your use cases and data for CPT alongside Fine-tuning. Learn more: https://lnkd.in/eNjbQm-m 

-- Multi-modal Models (MMMs): MMMs will gain prominence in 2024. Both commercial (like GPT-4V) and open-source models (like Llava) will be popular.
Action: Expand into business cases served by MMMs. More about Llava: https://lnkd.in/eTvn82iM.

-- AI Agents (RAG+++): AI agents using LLMs can improve upon RAG by intelligently utilizing multiple data sources.
Action: Prepare APIs and Data Sources for AI agents. More information: https://lnkd.in/eVf_J_bA.

-- LLMs with Graphs: Graphs are one of the best representations of real-world knowledge which when combined with LLMs can be very effective in various domains.
Action: Identify suitable business cases and explore Graphs+LLMs. Details: https://lnkd.in/eF68FbVA.

-- AI Routers: Most enterprises will end up using a dozen or more models and it will become necessary to manage multiple models - Auth, Audit and Smart Model Selection.
Action: Build an AI router. AWS Bedrock can assist, but more is needed. Info: https://go.aws/4aFLkyA.

-- FinOps meets MLOps: Focus on cost optimization for GenAI projects. 2023 was all about GenAI POCs; 2024 will be about production & big bills!
Action: Learn about GenAI business cases and FinOps for GenAI: https://lnkd.in/ezfV8NTa.

--Make AI Invisible. Technology is at its best when its invisible and seamless to the end user. 
Action: Look at existing enterprise applications and look for ways to rethink the user experience using GenAI while keeping the tech invisible. (https://bit.ly/3vkXvAO)

Kevin Petrie,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinpetrietech?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Data and AI leaders: what GenAI use cases are you piloting/implementing in 2024? Here's my take on the compelling use cases. Notably, some early adopters are tackling multiple use cases at once.

Check out this summary and tell us what you are doing. Also check out our recent Eckerson Group webinar with Intel Corporation, ""The Next Wave of GenAI: Domain-Specific LLMs."" https://lnkd.in/emF95Vaq.

To boost productivity and gain competitive advantage, GenAI adopters are not just using platforms such as ChatGPT from OpenAI or tools such as GitHub Copilot. They also are building language models into proprietary applications and workflows that consume their own domain-specific data. 

Companies implement these domain-specific LMs, which Eckerson Group also calls small language models, in one of three ways. They do this by building an LM from scratch, fine-tuning a pre-trained LM, or enriching prompts.

> Build from scratch. Data science teams design a new LM and train it on their own domain-specific use of language as well as their own facts.

> Fine-tune. They take a pre-trained LM such as Llama or BLOOM and fine-tune it on their domain-specific language and facts. 

> Enrich prompts. They inject domain-specific data into user prompts to ensure the LM gets the facts right.

By getting domain-specific, companies can reduce risks such as hallucinations or mishandling of intellectual property--provided they govern their inputs correctly!

Check out this summary and tell us what you think. Also check out our recent Eckerson Group webinar with Intel Corporation, ""The Next Wave of GenAI: Domain-Specific LLMs."" https://lnkd.in/emF95Vaq

Common use cases focus on customer service, document processing, research, sales, and marketing, as shown in the chart here. Here are early adopters that tackle a few at once. 

> This summer Priceline announced plans for an external chatbot to help customers book travel, as well as internal GenAI tools to help employees develop software and create marketing content. 

> Health providers at MEDITECH use GenAI to summarize patient histories, auto-generate clinical documents, and place orders. 

> Insurance provider Lemonade positions GenAI as a strategic differentiator for the entire business. Its latest letter to shareholders boasts  “we have LLMs trained to answer customer emails, review pet medical records, evaluate satellite and other imagery, read home condition reports, and more.”

Many organisations today seem to have shifted from being institutions that develop great talent to those that primarily seek ready-made talent.

 This trend overlooks the immense value of individuals who, despite lacking experience, possess a great attitude, commitment, and a team-oriented mindset. 

These qualities often outweigh the drawbacks of hiring experienced individuals with a fixed and toxic mindset.

The best organisations attract talent with their best years ahead of them, focusing on potential rather than past achievements. 

Let’s be clear this is more about mindset and willingness to learn and unlearn as apposed to age. 

To realise the incredible potential return, organisations must commit to creating an environment where continuous development is possible. 

This requires a multi-faceted approach:

1. Robust Training Programmes:
Employers should invest in comprehensive training programmes that equip employees with the necessary skills for their roles. This includes on-the-job training, mentorship programmes, online courses, and workshops.

2. Redefining Hiring Criteria:
Organisations should revise their hiring criteria to focus more on candidates’ potential and willingness to learn rather than solely on prior experience or formal qualifications. Behavioural interviews, aptitude tests, and probationary periods can help assess a candidate's ability to learn and adapt.


3. Partnerships with Educational Institutions:
Companies can collaborate with educational institutions to design curricula that align with industry needs. Apprenticeship programmes, internships, and cooperative education can bridge the gap between academic learning and practical job skills.


4. Lifelong Learning Culture:
Encouraging a culture of lifelong learning within organisations is crucial. Employers should provide ongoing education opportunities and support for professional development. 
This includes continuous skills assessment and access to resources for upskilling and reskilling.

5. Inclusive Recruitment Practices:
Employers should implement inclusive recruitment practices that remove biases and barriers. 
Blind recruitment, diversity quotas, and targeted outreach programmes can help ensure that diverse candidates are given a fair chance.


By implementing these measures, organisations can develop a workforce that is adaptable, innovative, and resilient, ensuring sustainable success and growth."
Drishti Sharma,https://in.linkedin.com/in/drishtiisharma?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"If you are a brand or creator planning to grow your own community, save this post for your next brand strategy session –

Follower counts are overrated. 
What truly matters for your brand is a community that talks back.

In the last 5+ years of building my personal brand along with Like Mind Tribe, I’ve learned this the hard (and beautiful) way. We often chase vanity metrics, namely likes, views, followers.

But the brands that actually grow focus on:
+ trust
+ conversations
+ creating spaces that people want to return to

My top 3 learnings about community building that most people ignore are👇
 
1/ Stop broadcasting. Start involving.

Don’t just talk to your audience, co-create with them.
Ask for their input.
Let them choose the next product, workshop, or event theme.
Your content should feel like a conversation, not a monologue.

2/ Trust builds in silence. Show up even when it’s quiet.

The real connection begins when no one’s clapping.
Be consistent with your presence.
Show your progress, not just your polished wins.

3/ Give them a space beyond social media.

DMs, Zoom rooms, meetups, or even a close friend's story list;
These micro-interactions are where loyalty is built.
If you want retention, give them a room where they feel seen.

————
I’ve met:
→ strangers who are now collaborators
→ community members who became accountability partners
→ even businesses that were born from casual coffee chats at our meetups

That’s what happens when you value:
Impact >>>>> Followers

Whether you're building a brand or just starting out as a creator –
Don’t just aim for attention. Create belonging.

Eric Partaker,https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ericpartaker?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Sales isn’t magic. It’s math.

But if your revenue isn’t growing, chance are...

It’s not your product.
It’s your system.

Let me explain.

The fastest-growing companies don’t have “better closers.”
They have better processes.

Here’s what top 1% sales teams do differently:

1. They multiply, not guess.
Revenue = Leads × Conversion Rate × Deal Size × Retention
Change one variable → growth. Change all four → rocket fuel.
That’s not a hack. That’s math.

2. They stop pitching and start listening.
The best reps talk 30% of the time.
The rest?
They listen for gold.

People don’t buy when they understand. They buy when they feel understood.

3. They don’t chase. They qualify fast.
🚫 Endless demos
🚫 Chasing low-fit leads

✅ Score prospects early
✅ Cut the dead weight
✅ Focus on buyers who are ready now

Time is your most expensive resource. Guard it.

4. They don’t sell the product. They sell the cost of inaction.

A great pitch isn’t about what you do. It’s about what your buyer loses by doing nothing.

Paint the pain.
Then make your offer the obvious solution.

5. They follow up with purpose.
80% of deals close after follow-up #5.
But most reps quit after #2.

Win the deal by staying in the game.
And bring value every time you follow up.

If you want sales that scale without burning out your team:
• Stop relying on heroics.
• Start building systems.
• Track the right KPIs.
• Make it easy for buyers to say yes.

Revenue isn’t a mystery.

It’s a repeatable machine. If you build it right.

I graduated with 8.53 CGPA from NSIT, thinking I was ready for the real world.

Spoiler alert: I wasn’t.

Here are 3 skills that would have saved me months of struggle:

1. How to Communicate Ideas (Not Just Code)

College taught me to write algorithms, not explain them to non-technical stakeholders.

At Microsoft, I realized brilliant code means nothing if you can’t:
• Present your solution to managers
• Write clear documentation  
• Explain complex problems simply

I had stage fear in college but had to become president of 3 societies to learn this the hard way.

2. Learning How to Learn (Fast)

College taught me Java and C++. The industry wanted React, Node.js, and cloud technologies.

The real skill isn’t memorizing syntax. It’s:
• Picking up new frameworks in weeks
• Adapting when requirements change overnight
• Unlearning old patterns when they don’t work

My Microsoft manager said it best: “Learn to unlearn.”

3. Building Real Solutions (Not Textbook Problems)

College problems have perfect inputs and expected outputs.
Real problems are messy, incomplete, and constantly changing.

Nobody teaches you:
• How to handle unclear requirements
• Working with legacy code that “just works”
• Balancing technical debt vs. delivery timelines

The brutal truth?
Your degree gets you the interview. These 3 skills get you the job and help you keep it.

What skill do you wish college had taught you? 👇

Carole Robin, Ph.D. spent 20+ years teaching a class called Interpersonal Dynamics, affectionately known as “Touchy Feely” at Stanford University Graduate School of Business. After leaving Stanford, she founded a nonprofit called Leaders In Tech, which applies the Touchy Feely principles to help Silicon Valley executives build their leadership and interpersonal skills. Carole also co-authored the popular book Connect: Building Exceptional Relationships with Family, Friends, and Colleagues, which shares key insights from her decades of teaching these courses.

- Apple: https://lnkd.in/eQw2HxcS

Some key takeaways:
1. When giving feedback, remember that in any interaction between two people, there are three realities:
- Reality 1 includes their motives and intent
- Reality 2 is what they say and do
- Reality 3 is the impact of their behavior on you

2. Embrace the 15% rule: By pushing yourself just 15% beyond your current boundaries, you can create opportunities for growth and deepen connections with others. This approach allows you to gauge your comfort level and adjust gradually, avoiding overwhelming discomfort while still fostering meaningful progress.

3. You should address minor irritations (“pinches”) before they escalate into major conflicts (“crunches”). Early identification and resolution of pinches promotes honest relationships and minimizes the expected pain of a crunch.

4. When someone responds in a way you didn’t expect, ask them, “What did you hear me say?” Most of the time, the other person heard something incorrect. Follow up with “I’m glad I asked; let me try that again.”

5. When seeking to understand someone’s motives and intent, inquire genuinely without judgment. Avoid asking “why” questions, as they provoke defensiveness. Instead ask what, when, where, and how to gain insight into their perspective.

6. Don’t use phrases like “I feel that” or “I feel like,” as these often lead to statements rather than emotional expressions. Instead, use “I feel” followed by an actual feeling word. This simple change is more likely to result in a connection with the other person."

4. When They Struggle Early On
↳ Instead of ""Maybe they’re not the right fit.""
↳ Say ""Are we giving them the right coaching and real opportunities?""

5. When Reviewing Performance
↳ Instead of ""They’re making a lot of calls.""
↳ Say ""Are they having high-quality conversations that convert?""

6. When They Start Closing Deals
↳ Instead of ""Nice work! Keep it up.""
↳ Say ""Let’s analyze what worked and scale it.""

7. When Holding Them Accountable
↳ Instead of ""Try harder next time.""
↳ Say ""What’s the root cause? What adjustment can we make?""

8. When They Face Objections
↳ Instead of ""Move on to the next lead.""
↳ Say ""Let’s uncover the real objection and solve it.""

9. When They Lose Momentum
↳ Instead of ""They must not be motivated.""
↳ Say ""Have we challenged, coached, and empowered them properly?""

10. When Evaluating Your Sales Culture
↳ Instead of ""Are my reps working hard?""
↳ Say ""Is our system setting them up to win?""

11. When Building a High-Performance Team

Bram Swinnen,https://be.linkedin.com/in/bram-swinnen-685659229?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Integrated brain training is a real game-changer for ACL rehab.

🤔 In sports, athletes perform in dynamic, unpredictable settings, making split-second decisions while executing complex movements. That's a far cry from the controlled environment of typical rehab sessions. 

💡 Rehab focuses on task-oriented exercises and internal feedback, but it might be missing the mark. From recent research it even seems that classic rehabilitation induces as much, if not more, of the neuroplasticity than the injury itself, increasing the risk of re-injury (Grooms, in press).
 
🏋️♀️ There’s a need for an implicit and dual-task approach in ACL rehab, starting from the early stages.
The video highlights the integration of this approach into ACL rehab.
 
🔴 SL squat right leg; Pass left; Count -1. 
🟢 Step-up right leg; Pass left; Count +1. 
🟣 SL RDL right leg; Count -2. 
🔵 SL squat left; Header. 
🟡 Step-up left leg; Header; Count +2. 
🩵 SL RDL left leg.
 
1️⃣ Neuromuscular deficits and muscle weakness occur at different central nervous system levels (Cortical, subcortical and spinal level) in ACL patients (Tayfur 2020, Bodkin 2019). These deficits in central activation are linked to poor recuperation of quadriceps activation and strength (Criss 2023). These neural deficits not only prevent effective strengthening, but also contribute to secondary injury risk (Capin 2016).
Impaired strength and central nervous system excitability persist for months to years after ACL surgery, suggesting the need for integrated brain training during the early stages of ACL rehab (Kuenze 2015). Traditional concentric exercises cannot overcome the inhibited cortical drive to the muscle and therefore fails to adequately activate muscles and restore neuromuscular control (Lepley 2015).
 
 
2️⃣ There's a link between how our brains work and the risk of ACL injuries. Brain activity related to visual, proprioceptive and attentional integration are crucial factors in rehab and prevention of ACL injury (Grooms 2022).
Interestingly, athletes with high-risk landing biomechanics following ACL rehab exhibit a brain activation pattern shifted toward increased visual-proprioceptive and spatial processing to organize movement. However, this heightened reliance on attentional and sensory processing for movement coordination might compromise their ability to effectively maintain neuromuscular control in high-pressure sports situations involving opponents or the ball (common scenarios for ACL injuries) (Villa 2020)

The current task-oriented rehab methods might actually reinforce these less effective brain activation patterns rather than fixing them. It is paramount to design rehab programs that challenge both the body and the brain, simulating the unpredictable situations athletes face during games. By integrating tasks that require perception, quick decision-making and neuromuscular control, we are able to retrain the brain and reduce the risk of injuries (Chaaban 2023, Grooms 2017).

Chris Walker,https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswalker171?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Old Way = Look at the Sales funnel by department
New Way = Look at the Sales funnel by buyer intent (how the buyer entered the sales funnel)

Historically, each department is measured by the blended performance of the “leads” they source with direct software-attribution. This model incentives getting the most “leads” and the lowest cost, not to drive *revenue & and sales productivity.

Marketing runs lead gen to first-touch attribution on as many contacts as possible to game attribution. It doesn’t actually drive customers to want to buy but appeases their outdated attribution models circa 2012.

Planning and forecasting breaks down because they blend content syndication leads that close at 0.1% with declared intent demo requests that win at 8%. Their old school “demand waterfall” model breaks like cheap glass.

Departments (Sales, Marketing, SDRs) fight over credit instead of working together because that’s how teams are measured and budgets are set.

It’s such an outdated model and a core driver of sales/marketing misalignment and other overall GTM problems.

Smart companies want to adopt an “All-Bound” model because they see this clear problem in their business, but need a new framework to measure success & make strategy adjustments.

Here’s how to make it happen:

1. Look at what GTM motion CAPTURED the demand (what was the trigger for how the buyer entered the pipeline). These are called “pipeline sources”.

2. These pipeline sources are a surrogate for **buyer intent** and will much better predict sales efficiency metrics like win rate, sales cycle length, and pipeline velocity.

3. Build a separate attribution model (e.g. self-reported attribution) to characterize what programs are CREATING the demand.

4. Use this data to OPTIMIZE your entire revenue strategy, not determine binary credit to teams, departments, and budgets.

Implementing this framework will:

1. Drive significantly better alignment between all GTM teams

2. Have all teams WORKING TOGETHER, not fighting each other for “credit”

3. Create an entirely new view for Revenue leaders and strategists to make far better decisions & strategy improvements

4. Dramatically improve your revenue planning and forecasting accuracy.

5. Clearly show you where to FOCUS and clearly show you what to STOP doing.

It’s 2023. Every department (Sales, Marketing, SDRs, Customer Success, etc.) contributes to every closed won customer.

Because of this, B2B companies need to establish a holistic, objective, comprehensive view of their entire GTM performance.

After working with countless leadership teams across industries, I've found that the most effective managers approach 1:1s with a fundamentally different mindset...

They see these meetings as investments in people, not project tracking sessions.

Great 1:1s focus on these three elements:

1. Support: 
Create space for authentic conversations about challenges, both professional and personal. When people feel safe discussing real obstacles, you can actually help remove them.

Questions to try: 
""What's currently making your job harder than it needs to be?"" 
""Where could you use more support from me?""

2. Growth: 
Use 1:1s to understand aspirations and build development paths. People who see a future with your team invest more deeply in the present.

Questions to explore: 
""What skills would you like to develop in the next six months?"" 
""What parts of your role energize you most?""

3. Alignment: 
Help team members connect their daily work to larger purpose and meaning. People work harder when they understand the ""why"" behind tasks.

Questions that create alignment: 
""How clear is the connection between your work and our team's priorities?"" 
""What part of our mission resonates most with you personally?""

By focusing less on immediate work outputs and more on the human doing the work, you'll actually see better performance, retention, and results.

No ads.
No paid funnels.
Not even daily content.

Just a simple but powerful system that brings in high-quality clients consistently.

She has around 18K followers in total.
But here’s the magic: almost all of her clients come through content + referrals.
Let me break it down for you 👇

1. High-Value, Results-Focused Offer
She’s a business coach, but instead of being vague, she helps people launch and scale group programs (which brings recurring revenue for her clients).

That means her service delivers clear, financial ROI.
She isn’t just offering “clarity” or “mindset”, she’s solving a specific problem with measurable outcomes.

Because of that, her clients stay longer. Some even work with her for 6+ months.
And just one client can bring her ₹1.5-2 lakhs over time.

2. Trust-Building Content
This is her superpower.

She doesn’t just post fluff or tips.

She shares:
Case studies of clients filling up their group programs
Screenshots of feedback from live calls
Simple behind-the-scenes of her process

People trust her not because she shouts the loudest, 
but because she shows real proof consistently.

➡️ Trust > virality, always.

3. Value-First Content
Once or twice a week, she drops short, snackable tips:

✅ A simple DM script that helped her land 5 discovery calls
✅ Her 3-step framework for filling up masterclasses
✅ Mistakes she sees new coaches make (and how to fix them)

These posts don’t always go viral.
But they’re shared, bookmarked, and make people say: “I learned something.”

That’s the kind of value that builds brand recall.

4. Subtle Differentiation
She doesn't bash other coaches.

She simply positions her offer in a clear, differentiated way:
""I don’t just help you attract leads, I help you convert them with zero ads and zero burnout.""

That line alone is a brand differentiator.

➡️ It’s not just about being different. It’s about being usefully different.

5. Her Secret Sauce: Referrals + DMs
She has a small but engaged circle.

And she shows up intentionally.

She replies to DMs. She sends voice notes. She checks in with past clients.

And she offers free 15-min strategy checks in exchange for referrals.

Because she’s easy to trust and easy to recommend,
she gets consistent warm leads, no cold pitching needed.

The Big Truth?
You don’t need a big following.
You need a clear offer, real proof, and a repeatable system to build trust.

If you're a coach trying to grow your personal brand and client base..
Start here. Nail this. And you won’t need to chase the algorithm ever again.

P.S. If you want to set this up for yourself, I created a free 5-day guide that helps you fix your profile, create content, and attract real leads from LinkedIn without wasting hours.
Drop a “5 DAY” and I’ll DM it to you."
Pushkar Singh,https://in.linkedin.com/in/pushkarsingh?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Have we ignored drones amidst this AI wave?

The recent war between India and Pakistan proved that the future of warfare lies with drones. India massively lags behind countries like China, Israel, and Turkey in drone technology. Indian private companies, including startups, have so far focused on using imported drones for land surveying, infrastructure monitoring, agriculture, logistics and other consumer use cases.

The country has ignored manufacturing drones for the defence industry. Thankfully, the situation is changing. The Government of India (GOI) is launching a Rs 2 billion ($234 M) incentive programme for civil and military drone makers to reduce their reliance on imported components.

A recent study estimates that drone manufacturing can become a $23B industry in the next 10 years. While agriculture will have the largest drone use case, defence won't be left behind. GOI recognises that India must manufacture drones to become self-sufficient in defence.

Once the investors realise that the government could be a big buyer of military drones, they will start funding drone manufacturing startups. An increasing Indian defence budget, with drones playing a significant role in the overall defence strategy, is a strong tailwind that will propel drone manufacturing in India.

However, there is no magic bullet to make India a drone manufacturing powerhouse. It's not a problem that can be solved by throwing billions of dollars. Modern drones are complex machines with advanced engineering components like  FCU (Flight Controllers), ESC (Electronic Speed Controllers), IMU (Inertial Measurement Units), Ultrasonic sensors, GPS modules, Motors, Frames, Propellers, Chassis, etc.

Manufacturing drones at scale requires tight tolerances, lightweight frames, and high-density PCB designs. Indian SMEs and startups lack the precision engineering expertise to manufacture these components. It will take years, if not decades, before India is ready to manufacture these on a large scale.

On top of all the hardware challenges, India suffers from software gaps in real-time edge computing, computer vision, and swarm intelligence. However, I don't expect software to be a bottleneck.

The country has enough talent to build stacks for Autonomous Navigation and Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping Technology. I expect the hardware to be a far bigger challenge.

The big question is how quickly we can upskill the manufacturing workforce and build labs and factories to overcome precision engineering challenges.

This will determine our tryst with drone manufacturing.

This could change the game. 🎯

The FAA just dropped their 700-page BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) rule proposal—and it's the regulatory breakthrough the logistics industry has been waiting for since 2021. 📋

🔑 Key BVLOS Highlights That Matter:
Corporate responsibility model 🏢 - Companies (not individual pilots) manage compliance
Dual pathways 🛤️: Permits for low-risk ops, Certificates for large-scale operations
Drones up to 1,320 lbs ⚖️ - Way beyond current 55 lb Part 107 limits
Automated Data Service Providers 🤖 - FAA-approved UTM systems manage traffic
Operations over people allowed 👥 (with restrictions)
Air corridors 🛫 for predetermined, scalable routes

🇺🇸 The US Numbers (Finally) Don't Lie:
Drone delivery market exploding from $1.08B (2025) → $4.40B (2030) 📈
Drone units scaling 8x: from 32,456 to 275,703 units by 2030 🔢
Last-mile costs slashed by 93% with optimized drone routes 💰

⚡ The Game-Changing Impact No more individual waivers. No more regulatory roadblocks. This 700-page rule creates a standardized pathway for:
Package delivery at scale 📦
Medical supply chains to remote areas 🏥
Agricultural monitoring across vast territories 🌾
Emergency response operations 🚨
Infrastructure inspections 🔍

But here's the reality check: We're playing catch-up. ⏰
🇨🇳 While the US was stuck in regulatory limbo, China was scaling:
Meituan: 450,000+ commercial deliveries across 53 urban routes 🏙️
SF Express: 12,000 daily deliveries, 800-2,000 daily takeoffs in one region alone 📊
JD.com: Operating since 2016, now delivering to the Great Wall of China 🏯
China's goal: 10% of ALL deliveries by drone within 5-10 years 🎯

🚀 The opportunity to catch up is REAL (But the Window is Closing): While Meituan delivers milk tea in dense urban Shenzhen in under 15 minutes ⏱️, US companies like Walmart and Wing are finally proving 19-minute delivery times. The infrastructure gap is real, but not insurmountable. 💪

The strategic question
This isn't just about drones—it's about reimagining what ""fast delivery"" means in 2025 and beyond. The companies moving now will own the advantage when the final rule drops in Q1 2026. ⚡

The race is on. China has a head start. But American innovation + regulatory clarity = game changer. 🏁

Tim Peter,https://www.linkedin.com/in/timpeter?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Recently, Hospitality Net asked their Digital Marketing in Hospitality panel how hotels could use AI to shift bookings from OTAs to their direct channels. You might find this answer interesting: 
In the near term, the biggest opportunities AI provides for driving direct revenue revolve around creating richer, more personalized experiences at each stage of the guest journey. Hotel marketers can use AI to better segment potential guests based on behaviors and deliver content and offers — at scale — that match those segments’ intent. Increasingly, you can let the AI select and orchestrate campaign messages, images, and offers that align with the needs of potential guests, and drive conversion. Similarly, these tools can provide intelligent rate displays and offer attractive upsell opportunities to guests to improve the revenue you achieve during each stay. Real-time guest service during the booking process, including chat, can help improve that experience and increase conversion rate. 
Of course, the guest journey doesn’t end at time of booking. Again, savvy hotel commercial teams are beginning to put AI to work to upsell and cross-sell on-property experiences during the pre-arrival and on-property stages of the guest journey to drive greater share of wallet. And, of course, intelligent, automated post-stay campaigns are beginning to produce results in driving repeat bookings from past guests. 
In the longer term, we’ve not yet seen how universal access to AI assistants will shape guest behavior. These tools are likely to shift the way guests interact with information and experiences every bit as much as the internet, mobile, and social media have. We should expect to see new marketing and distribution channels that make it easy for us to reach guests directly — and new gatekeepers who seek to insert themselves into that process. Every silver lining comes wrapped in its own cloud. 
Regardless, these benefits come with a cost. Hoteliers must take a serious look at their existing tech stack and team skills to ensure they’re ready to put these tools to work. Take a look at the partners you work with. Do they make it easy to connect with new sales and marketing partners? Do they have a well-articulated vision for how they’ll incorporate AI into their products? Have they begun to deliver on that vision? If so, you’re in great shape. If not, it may be time to start looking at alternatives. 
And, finally, don’t ignore your people. Does your team have the skills, the resources, and the vision needed to adapt to a changing customer and technology landscape? You will want to give them the support they need to quickly adjust as guest behaviors — and those of your competitors — evolve. The hoteliers who are able to learn the fastest, and put those learnings to use, are the ones most likely to succeed at driving more direct business as AI becomes more common. And there’s nothing artificial about that.

Nick Abrahams,https://au.linkedin.com/in/nickabrahams?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"If you are an organisation using AI or you are an AI developer, the Australian privacy regulator has just published some vital information about AI and your privacy obligations. 

Here is a summary of the new guides for businesses published today by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner which articulate how Australian privacy law applies to AI and set out the regulator’s expectations.

The first guide is aimed to help businesses comply with their privacy obligations when using commercially available AI products and help them to select an appropriate product. The second provides privacy guidance to developers using personal information to train generative AI models.


GUIDE ONE: Guidance on privacy and the use of commercially available AI products

Top five takeaways
* 		Privacy obligations will apply to any personal information input into an AI system, as well as the output data generated by AI (where it contains personal information). 
* 		Businesses should update their privacy policies and notifications with clear and transparent information about their use of AI
* 		If AI systems are used to generate or infer personal information, including images, this is a collection of personal information and must comply with APP 3 (which deals with collection of personal info).
* 		If personal information is being input into an AI system, APP 6 requires entities to only use or disclose the information for the primary purpose for which it was collected.
* 		As a matter of best practice, the OAIC recommends that organisations do not enter personal information, and particularly sensitive information, into publicly available generative AI tools.


GUIDE 2: Guidance on privacy and developing and training generative AI models

Top five takeaways
* 		Developers must take reasonable steps to ensure accuracy in generative AI models.
* 		Just because data is publicly available or otherwise accessible does not mean it can legally be used to train or fine-tune generative AI models or systems..
* 		Developers must take particular care with sensitive information, which generally requires consent to be collected.
* 		Where developers are seeking to use personal information that they already hold for the purpose of training an AI model, and this was not a primary purpose of collection, they need to carefully consider their privacy obligations.
* 		Where a developer cannot clearly establish that a secondary use for an AI-related purpose was within reasonable expectations and related to a primary purpose, to avoid regulatory risk they should seek consent for that use and/or offer individuals a meaningful and informed ability to opt-out of such a use.

Antonio Grasso,https://it.linkedin.com/in/antgrasso?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"In an era where data sharing is essential and concerning, six fundamental techniques are emerging to protect privacy while enabling valuable insights.

Fully Homomorphic Encryption involves encrypting data before being shared, allowing analysis without decoding the original information, thus safeguarding sensitive details.

Differential Privacy adds noise variables to a dataset, making decoding the initial inputs impossible, maintaining privacy while allowing generalized analysis.

Functional Encryption provides selected users a key to view specific parts of the encrypted text, offering relevant insights while withholding other details.

Federated Analysis allows parties to share only the insights from their analysis, not the data itself, promoting collaboration without direct exposure.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs enable users to prove their knowledge of a value without revealing it, supporting secure verification without unnecessary exposure.

Secure Multi-Party Computation distributes data analysis across multiple parties, so no single entity can see the complete set of inputs, ensuring a collaborative yet compartmentalized approach.

Together, these techniques pave the way for a more responsible and secure data management and analytics future.

Ambika Pande,https://in.linkedin.com/in/ambikapande?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"📊 Your apps are spying on you, but will DPDPA enforcement protect you from it? Probably not.

With the DPDP Act introduced in '23, and enforcement being rolled out from November '25 it seems governments are finally making moves to protect consumer data. But what are they really protecting?

❓Sure, there’s effort around protecting the customer personal data: phone number, email, bank statement (keen to see how this enforced by the way, at this point it feels like every loan app out there has my number) But what about your second level data: the behavioral, inferred data, and the profiling story? 

🚨 I've written about this in the past - we joke about how apps are listening in to our everyday conversations, but that isn't far from the truth. Apps are silently detecting other apps installed on your phone without consent. And it doesn’t seem like any privacy laws are protecting us from this anytime soon. 

Here's the thing. I honestly don’t care who has my number anymore. It’s probably been leaked, sold or scraped by now. What I do care about is profiling done without my knowledge. Example: Zomato checks forRedbus, OYO, & fantasy gaming. Swiggy checks for Zara, FirstCry, and others. (Why does a food app need to know that I shop for baby products?). And this isn’t theoretical. This can and does lead to discriminatory pricing: different loan rates, insurance premiums or offers based on assumptions inferred from your app list

My problem isn’t just that this happens. It’s that I don’t even know. On iOS, up to 50 such “silent queries” are allowed. On Android? Up to 1000.  And while GDPR has laws against PII data usage & AI profiling, clearly they aren’t enforcing this

This also seems to be a limitation of the DPDP Act. It’s built around the themes of user consent, purpose limitation, data minimisation, and data fiduciary accountability. It isn’t built around restricting customer profiling or preventing surveillance. So then, paradoxically: 

✅  Asking for explicit customer data (PAN / Aadhar) is clearly regulated
❗Inferring behaviour via app installs or transaction patterns without the customer’s knowledge is not, which is actually even more invasive than explicit PII data! 

Ideally collecting this data should fall under the data minimization / purpose limitation themes, but that doesn’t seem to be the lens that DPDP has taken at this point. And because the collection of this data is framed as a “fraud / risk” need, and / or as operational metadata it often bypasses the minimization / limitation themes, when it is essentially behavioral fingerprinting, and often more revealing than regulated personal data!

Privacy isn’t just about what we give away knowingly. (and since we don’t know we can’t file a complaint). It’s also about what gets extracted without us knowing. 

We need better answers. And stronger laws

🧠 Deep dive in comments."
Akhil Mishra,https://in.linkedin.com/in/itsakhilmishra?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"""But we’re not a big company!""

DPDP fines don’t care.

""It’s just a small app update.""

That’s how it all starts.

• You collect a bit more data.

• Then a bit more.

Before you know it, you’re storing sensitive information without proper protection.

Ignoring user consent. Neglecting security.

And you tell yourself - this is what innovation looks like, right?

Growth. Data-driven decisions. No limits.

WRONG.

Companies think speed trumps structure - until it doesn’t. 

The DPDP Act doesn’t bend for innovation excuses. 

It demands accountability.

That ""small oversight"" isn’t small anymore. 

Non-compliance can mean fines up to ₹250 crore. 

Now, Web and App development companies are uniquely impacted by the DPDP Act.

Because you often serve as the frontline collectors and processors of personal data. 

And if you’re building something big for your clients, like a digital lending platform, you need structure. 

As for the companies, without privacy compliance, your business will crumble. 

And you’ll have nothing left for the users you’re trying to serve.

But the good thing is that this is entirely preventable.

So what I suggest here is:

1) Conduct a data audit every quarter.

Identify what you collect and eliminate what’s not important.

2) Implement Privacy by Design.

Merge data protection into your development process from day one.

3) Educate your team on the DPDP Act.

Make sure everyone understands their role in compliance.

4) Stay updated on legal changes.

Assign someone to monitor updates to data protection laws.

5) Put user trust first.

Be transparent about data practices and give users control.

The end goal here is to be intentional. 

It’s to protect your users.

Because once their trust is gone, you don’t get it back.

And remember, the DPDP Act isn’t here to slow you down - it’s here to make sure you last.

 👉 TL;DR: Privacy compliance isn’t optional. Follow DPDP regulations now, or risk losing trust - and paying the price later."

Khang NGUYEN TRIEU,https://sg.linkedin.com/in/knguyentrieu?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"My #WiT2025 takeaways (1/10): Hospitality Show-off Luxury is dead. Long live Meaning. The new battleground in Asia Pacific hospitality is not distribution or price. It's Experience Orchestration. If your tech stack creates friction, you're losing the most valuable guest. 

1. The Luxury Pivot: From Having to Becoming

Luxury is shifting from material expense (""bling"") to profound personal connection and purpose. Top-tier clients are moving from having (material goods) to becoming (experiences), favoring experiences that emphasize social impact or personal immersion.

Some panelists therefore mentioned that the core metric for success is moving beyond RevPAR and occupancy to the Return on Emotional Investment (ROE). Loyalty is no longer just driven by points, but in some cases by co-creation and ""money-can't-buy experiences"", such as COMO Hotels and Resorts collaborating with NASA, as mentioned by Puneet Mahindroo during WiT (Web in Travel).

2. The Crisis of Data Orchestration

While distribution channels are largely ""solved"" (or at least manageable at scale today), the biggest challenge is Experience Orchestration. Systematic data fragmentation still prevents a unified view of the guest, meaning technology operates in silos (pre-stay versus in-stay, F&B, spa, rooms) while the guest interacts with the hotel as a single entity. This causes visible friction: even guests who pre-check-in online frequently waste time at the front desk being asked for information they have already provided. This friction is most acute during the transition from the platform (mostly OTA but also direct) to the physical check-in. This aspect is key as a better in-stay experience may increase the probability for a guest to return by 3.8x according to panelists.

3. OTAs as Experience Partners, Not Gatekeepers

In the long standing “love-hate” relationships between OTAs and Hotels, Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) are pushing to redefine their role, shifting from being mere ""gatekeepers"" to genuine experience partners. For example, according to Xing Xiong, COO of Trip.com, more than 50% of guest queries on platforms like Trip.com occur before the booking is finalized. By providing AI-enabled tools and pre-sale support, OTAs aim to reduce customer friction and increase conversion.

4. Scaling Independent Hospitality

Independent hotel groups, such as Worldwide Hotels (WWH), benefit from flexibility and agility. As Carolyn Choo, her CEO, pointed out, the democratization of technology, especially AI, acts as an ""equalizer,"" enabling independent operators to adopt powerful, non-proprietary revenue management and guest experience tools.

In highly fragmented sectors, like luxury villas and rentals, scaling is best achieved through an M&A roll-up strategy as mentioned by Stephanie Chai from The Luxe Nomad: acquiring specialized property management companies to gain scale and market expertise.

In June 2025, a Shahed-136 MS001 drone was shot down over Sumy region. At first glance, it seemed ordinary — but inside was a glimpse into the future of aerial warfare.

This isn’t just a modernized model. It’s a technological leap: artificial intelligence, thermal vision, hardened navigation, real-time telemetry, and swarm logic. This is no longer a munition carrier — it’s an autonomous combat platform that sees, analyzes, decides, and strikes without external commands.

Shahed MS001 doesn’t carry coordinates — it thinks.
It identifies targets, selects the highest-value one, adjusts its trajectory, and adapts to changes — even in the face of GPS jamming or target maneuvers. This is not a loitering munition. It is a digital predator.

 Most air defense systems are not prepared for this.
Mass deployment of drones like MS001 isn’t just a threat — it’s a challenge to our entire doctrine of air defense.

What was found inside the MS001:
• Nvidia Jetson Orin — machine learning, video processing, object recognition
• Thermal imager — operates at night and in low visibility
• Nasir GPS with CRPA antenna — spoof-resistant navigation
• FPGA chips — onboard adaptive logic
• Radio modem — for telemetry and swarm communication

MS001 operates in coordinated drone groups: adjusting paths, bypassing air defenses, persisting even under electronic warfare and partial loss of swarm members.

Russia is already field-testing tomorrow’s combat AI. While we hold procurement rounds, they’re integrating tech into a single adaptive system. MS001 proves that wars aren’t won by budget — they’re won by integration.

Since early 2024, Russia has shifted its strikes away from the front line to deep in the rear — energy, logistics, civilian infrastructure. In this campaign, Shaheds are not just tools — they are strategic actors.

We are not only fighting Russia. We are fighting inertia.
And if we don’t break it now — the next generation of drones will break it for us."

With recent advancements from Google, Microsoft, IBM and Amazon in developing more powerful and stable quantum chips, the trajectory of QC is accelerating faster than many of us expected.
 
Google’s Sycamore and next gen Willow chips are demonstrating increasing fidelity. Microsoft’s pursuit of topological qubits using Majorana particles promises longer coherence times and IBM’s roadmap is pushing towards modular error corrected systems. These aren’t just incremental steps, they are setting the stage for scalable, fault tolerant quantum machines. 
 
Quantum systems excel at simulating the behavior of molecules and materials at atomic scale, solving optimization problems with exponentially large solution spaces and modeling complex probabilistic systems – tasks that could take classical supercomputers millennia. For example, accurately simulating protein folding or discovering new catalysts for carbon capture are well within quantum’s potential reach.
 
If scalable QC is just five years away, now is the time to ask : 

What would you do differently today, if quantum was real tomorrow ?. 

That question isn’t hypothetical – it’s an invitation to start rethinking foundational problems in chemistry, logistics, finance, AI and cryptography.
 
Of course building quantum systems is notoriously hard. Fragile qubits, error correction and decoherence remain formidable challenges. But globally public and private institutions are pouring resources into cracking these problems. I was in LA today visiting the famous USC Information Sciences Institute where cutting edge work on QC is underway and the energy is palpable.

"Peter Slattery, PhD",https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterslattery1?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"""The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI systems can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. With recent advances in AI models and hardware, EAI systems are becoming increasingly capable across wider operational domains. 

While EAI systems can offer many benefits, they also pose significant risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, as well as economic and societal disruption. These risks require urgent attention from policymakers, as existing policies governing industrial robots and autonomous vehicles are insufficient to address the full range of concerns EAI systems present. 

To help address this issue, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a taxonomy of the physical, informational, economic, and social risks EAI systems pose. Second, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to assess how existing frameworks address these risks and to identify critical gaps. We conclude by offering policy recommendations for the safe and beneficial deployment of EAI systems, such as mandatory testing and certification schemes, clarified liability frameworks, and strategies to manage EAI’s potentially transformative economic and societal impacts""

Laura Jeffords Greenberg,https://dk.linkedin.com/in/laurajeffordsgreenberg?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"What I’ve learned from teaching lawyers how to use AI.

For over two years, I’ve been teaching legal teams how to use AI. AI adoption isn’t like past legal tech waves. Lawyers are more engaged, excited, and optimistic about AI than past legal tech solutions. 

Here are nine trends I'm seeing in AI adoption in legal teams: 

1️⃣ Early adopters are driving change. 

Lawyers that already use AI in their daily lives are advocating for AI use, teaching and pushing their legal teams forward.

2️⃣ Hesitant lawyers tend fall into two camps.

(1) Skeptics (rightly questioning the results) and 
(2) Cautious users (worried about how data is used, and/or inputting confidential information or personal data).

3️⃣ Most teams recognize they need training to use AI effectively.

Adoption happens when lawyers find their own use case(s). That requires access to tools, training, and freedom to experiment. Until then, AI remains a novelty.

4️⃣ Keeping up is hard. 

Everyone feels the intensity of the pace of change. Even Ethan Mollick and Allie K. Miller acknowledge it's hard to keep up. Although I've been impressed with Kyle Bahr's articles and posts!

5️⃣ AI champions are emerging. 

More legal teams are designating AI champions, lawyers, legal ops pros, legal engineers, governance leads, or internal AI advocates to drive adoption within their teams and also across the company. You have a unique opportunity to become an AI expert and make an impact across entire organizations. (For example, I taught a CTO how to improve the instructions for a company GPT!)

6️⃣ Broad-purpose AI tools are hitting limitations. 

Legal teams who started with in-house OpenAI ChatGPT solutions and similar tools, like Copilot, are running into walls. They are beginning to see they need legal-specific AI solutions. One major challenge is articulating this need to their organization to justify additional budget for legal specific tools. 

7️⃣ Understanding AI is a tool, not magic. 

More legal professionals now understand that AI won’t replace them. It’s here to make their work more efficient, not take over entirely.

8️⃣ Integration is the key to long-term adoption. 

The legal teams making the most progress are the ones experimenting and exploring how they can embed AI into daily workflows. These teams are moving beyond prompting, and building assistants and embedding AI tools into workflows.

9️⃣ Adoption isn’t fast. 

Discovering how AI can work for you and actually building solutions are two different exercises. Both require investment to see real returns.

I'd love to know whether you are seeing the same trends? Or have you experienced some of these observations play out?"
Cathy Hackl,https://www.linkedin.com/in/cathyhackl?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Here's my latest published by the World Economic Forum and it seems like an extremely relevant topic after humanoid robots just ran the marathon in China and the unveiling of Google's XR glasses at TED 2025. 

We’re moving into the next frontier of computing:
Where intelligence doesn’t just live in the cloud. It lives around us and expands into the physical world. 

On our faces, in our ears, in our pockets, walking next to us, and soon… maybe even working for us.
This is the era of:
 🔹 On-device AI: fast, hopefully private, and context-aware
 🔹 Spatial computing: blending physical and digital realities and expanding computing into the physical world while enabling the spatial web. 
 🔹 Smartglasses & wearables: interfaces you wear, not just touch
 🔹 Agentic AI systems that act, decide, and adapt
 🔹 Vision-action models: the brain behind embodied AI
And it’s not just about smartglasses like the ones Google XR, Meta, OpenAI or Meta are working on.

It’s about the rise of Physical AI, where robots and spatially aware machines use spatial intelligence to understand and operate in the physical world.

Think AI that can see, move, and collaborate in physical space... not just generate words. Our current LLMs are truly revolutionary, but vision action models will have an even bigger impact on our daily lives. 

This convergence of AI + XR + robotics is reshaping business:
From how we access information…
To how we work, care, learn, create, and connect.

If you’re a founder, leader, designer, or investor...this is your moment to build and design for what’s next. It's never been easier to build

And if you’re curious to go deeper, I’m working on a course with one of the top minds in AI to help leaders get ready for what’s coming.

This quote in the article from Boston Consulting Group (BCG)'s Kristi Woolsey sums it up well: “AI has put us on the hunt for a new device that will let us move AI collaboration off-screen and into the world. Hands-free XR devices do that. AI is also hungry for data, and the cameras, location sensors and voice inputs of XR devices can feed that need.”

This hardware shift makes AI more accessible and integrated into daily life, not just as a tool on a screen, but of use to use in the physical world.

Patrick Salyer,https://www.linkedin.com/in/patricksalyer?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"My partner at Mayfield Fund, Vijay R., and Gamiel Gran & Shelby Golan who lead our CXO team gathered industry AI thought leaders from companies like Meta, Google, Amazon, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Cisco, Databricks, and more to discuss trends in the Large Language Model (LLM) ecosystem.  Great discussion, in particular highlighting many bottlenecks like hardware, cost, data, and more.  Also, further validation that enterprises are still nescient in their adoption maturity and looking for help!  It's still early!

Here were some key insights:  
 
Hardware Limitations: Silicon systems are a bottleneck for AI advancement, with hardware constraints expected to persist for the next 4-5 years.
 
Cost Reduction: Advancements in software and architecture like edge computing are anticipated to significantly reduce AI-related costs, facilitating broader enterprise adoption.
 
Data Scarcity and Utilization: The scarcity of authentic data, particularly in text, poses a challenge, necessitating innovative approaches to data sourcing and utilization.
 
Open Source vs. Closed Source: The choice between open source and closed source AI models hinges on organizational goals, control over intellectual property, and cost; both models are expected to succeed albeit with probably less than 10 models as the market evolves.
 
AI Opportunities & Challenges: AI presents vast opportunities in domain-specific models and software efficiencies, but faces challenges like compute access and geopolitical tensions.
 
Maturity in Enterprise AI: Enterprises are focusing on addressing basic foundational issues before fully leveraging AI capabilities."
Katharina Koerner,https://www.linkedin.com/in/katharina-koerner-privacyengineering?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"This new white paper by Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) titled ""Rethinking Privacy in the AI Era"" addresses the intersection of data privacy and AI development, highlighting the challenges and proposing solutions for mitigating privacy risks. 

It outlines the current data protection landscape, including the Fair Information Practice Principles, GDPR, and U.S. state privacy laws, and discusses the distinction and regulatory implications between predictive and generative AI. 

The paper argues that AI's reliance on extensive data collection presents unique privacy risks at both individual and societal levels, noting that existing laws are inadequate for the emerging challenges posed by AI systems, because they don't fully tackle the shortcomings of the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPs) framework or concentrate adequately on the comprehensive data governance measures necessary for regulating data used in AI development. 

According to the paper, FIPs are outdated and not well-suited for modern data and AI complexities, because:

- They do not address the power imbalance between data collectors and individuals.
- FIPs fail to enforce data minimization and purpose limitation effectively.
- The framework places too much responsibility on individuals for privacy management.
- Allows for data collection by default, putting the onus on individuals to opt out.
- Focuses on procedural rather than substantive protections.
- Struggles with the concepts of consent and legitimate interest, complicating privacy management.

It emphasizes the need for new regulatory approaches that go beyond current privacy legislation to effectively manage the risks associated with AI-driven data acquisition and processing. 

The paper suggests three key strategies to mitigate the privacy harms of AI:

1.) Denormalize Data Collection by Default: 
Shift from opt-out to opt-in data collection models to facilitate true data minimization. This approach emphasizes ""privacy by default"" and the need for technical standards and infrastructure that enable meaningful consent mechanisms.

2.) Focus on the AI Data Supply Chain: 
Enhance privacy and data protection by ensuring dataset transparency and accountability throughout the entire lifecycle of data. This includes a call for regulatory frameworks that address data privacy comprehensively across the data supply chain.

3.) Flip the Script on Personal Data Management: 
Encourage the development of new governance mechanisms and technical infrastructures, such as data intermediaries and data permissioning systems, to automate and support the exercise of individual data rights and preferences. This strategy aims to empower individuals by facilitating easier management and control of their personal data in the context of AI.

Hitanshu Shrivastava,https://in.linkedin.com/in/hitanshu714?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Are we measuring AI the wrong way?

LLM benchmarks are everywhere—accuracy, translation, coding ability, you name it. But here’s the catch: Do these metrics really matter to businesses?

In the real world, no one cares if an AI scores 90% on an academic dataset. What matters is whether it saves time, reduces costs, or drives better decisions.

The problem? Most benchmarks ignore real-world challenges like adaptability, context, or scalability. They look great on paper but often fall short in practice.

It’s time we rethink how we measure AI. Instead of focusing on isolated capabilities, let’s test for outcomes that drive actual value.

Elfried Samba,https://uk.linkedin.com/in/elfriedsamba?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Louder for the people at the back 🎤

Many organisations today seem to have shifted from being institutions that develop great talent to those that primarily seek ready-made talent.

 This trend overlooks the immense value of individuals who, despite lacking experience, possess a great attitude, commitment, and a team-oriented mindset. 

These qualities often outweigh the drawbacks of hiring experienced individuals with a fixed and toxic mindset.

The best organisations attract talent with their best years ahead of them, focusing on potential rather than past achievements. 

Let’s be clear this is more about mindset and willingness to learn and unlearn as apposed to age. 

To realise the incredible potential return, organisations must commit to creating an environment where continuous development is possible. 

This requires a multi-faceted approach:

1. Robust Training Programmes:
Employers should invest in comprehensive training programmes that equip employees with the necessary skills for their roles. This includes on-the-job training, mentorship programmes, online courses, and workshops.

2. Redefining Hiring Criteria:
Organisations should revise their hiring criteria to focus more on candidates’ potential and willingness to learn rather than solely on prior experience or formal qualifications. Behavioural interviews, aptitude tests, and probationary periods can help assess a candidate's ability to learn and adapt.


3. Partnerships with Educational Institutions:
Companies can collaborate with educational institutions to design curricula that align with industry needs. Apprenticeship programmes, internships, and cooperative education can bridge the gap between academic learning and practical job skills.


4. Lifelong Learning Culture:
Encouraging a culture of lifelong learning within organisations is crucial. Employers should provide ongoing education opportunities and support for professional development. 
This includes continuous skills assessment and access to resources for upskilling and reskilling.

5. Inclusive Recruitment Practices:
Employers should implement inclusive recruitment practices that remove biases and barriers. 
Blind recruitment, diversity quotas, and targeted outreach programmes can help ensure that diverse candidates are given a fair chance.


By implementing these measures, organisations can develop a workforce that is adaptable, innovative, and resilient, ensuring sustainable success and growth."
Drishti Sharma,https://in.linkedin.com/in/drishtiisharma?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"If you are a brand or creator planning to grow your own community, save this post for your next brand strategy session –

Follower counts are overrated. 
What truly matters for your brand is a community that talks back.

In the last 5+ years of building my personal brand along with Like Mind Tribe, I’ve learned this the hard (and beautiful) way. We often chase vanity metrics, namely likes, views, followers.

But the brands that actually grow focus on:
+ trust
+ conversations
+ creating spaces that people want to return to

My top 3 learnings about community building that most people ignore are👇
 
1/ Stop broadcasting. Start involving.

Don’t just talk to your audience, co-create with them.
Ask for their input.
Let them choose the next product, workshop, or event theme.
Your content should feel like a conversation, not a monologue.

2/ Trust builds in silence. Show up even when it’s quiet.

The real connection begins when no one’s clapping.
Be consistent with your presence.
Show your progress, not just your polished wins.

3/ Give them a space beyond social media.

DMs, Zoom rooms, meetups, or even a close friend's story list;
These micro-interactions are where loyalty is built.
If you want retention, give them a room where they feel seen.

————
I’ve met:
→ strangers who are now collaborators
→ community members who became accountability partners
→ even businesses that were born from casual coffee chats at our meetups

That’s what happens when you value:

Whether you're building a brand or just starting out as a creator –
Don’t just aim for attention. Create belonging.

But if your revenue isn’t growing, chance are...

It’s not your product.
It’s your system.

Let me explain.

The fastest-growing companies don’t have “better closers.”
They have better processes.

Here’s what top 1% sales teams do differently:

1. They multiply, not guess.
Revenue = Leads × Conversion Rate × Deal Size × Retention
Change one variable → growth. Change all four → rocket fuel.
That’s not a hack. That’s math.

2. They stop pitching and start listening.
The best reps talk 30% of the time.
The rest?
They listen for gold.

People don’t buy when they understand. They buy when they feel understood.

3. They don’t chase. They qualify fast.
🚫 Endless demos
🚫 Chasing low-fit leads

✅ Score prospects early
✅ Cut the dead weight
✅ Focus on buyers who are ready now

Time is your most expensive resource. Guard it.

4. They don’t sell the product. They sell the cost of inaction.

A great pitch isn’t about what you do. It’s about what your buyer loses by doing nothing.

Paint the pain.
Then make your offer the obvious solution.

5. They follow up with purpose.
80% of deals close after follow-up #5.
But most reps quit after #2.

Win the deal by staying in the game.
And bring value every time you follow up.

If you want sales that scale without burning out your team:
• Stop relying on heroics.
• Start building systems.
• Track the right KPIs.
• Make it easy for buyers to say yes.

Revenue isn’t a mystery.

It’s a repeatable machine. If you build it right.

I graduated with 8.53 CGPA from NSIT, thinking I was ready for the real world.

Spoiler alert: I wasn’t.

Here are 3 skills that would have saved me months of struggle:

1. How to Communicate Ideas (Not Just Code)

College taught me to write algorithms, not explain them to non-technical stakeholders.

At Microsoft, I realized brilliant code means nothing if you can’t:
• Present your solution to managers
• Write clear documentation  
• Explain complex problems simply

I had stage fear in college but had to become president of 3 societies to learn this the hard way.

2. Learning How to Learn (Fast)

College taught me Java and C++. The industry wanted React, Node.js, and cloud technologies.

The real skill isn’t memorizing syntax. It’s:
• Picking up new frameworks in weeks
• Adapting when requirements change overnight
• Unlearning old patterns when they don’t work

My Microsoft manager said it best: “Learn to unlearn.”

3. Building Real Solutions (Not Textbook Problems)

College problems have perfect inputs and expected outputs.
Real problems are messy, incomplete, and constantly changing.

Nobody teaches you:
• How to handle unclear requirements
• Working with legacy code that “just works”
• Balancing technical debt vs. delivery timelines

The brutal truth?
Your degree gets you the interview. These 3 skills get you the job and help you keep it.

What skill do you wish college had taught you? 👇

- Spotify: https://lnkd.in/egW9afwc
- Apple: https://lnkd.in/eQw2HxcS

Some key takeaways:
1. When giving feedback, remember that in any interaction between two people, there are three realities:
- Reality 1 includes their motives and intent
- Reality 2 is what they say and do
- Reality 3 is the impact of their behavior on you

2. Embrace the 15% rule: By pushing yourself just 15% beyond your current boundaries, you can create opportunities for growth and deepen connections with others. This approach allows you to gauge your comfort level and adjust gradually, avoiding overwhelming discomfort while still fostering meaningful progress.

3. You should address minor irritations (“pinches”) before they escalate into major conflicts (“crunches”). Early identification and resolution of pinches promotes honest relationships and minimizes the expected pain of a crunch.

4. When someone responds in a way you didn’t expect, ask them, “What did you hear me say?” Most of the time, the other person heard something incorrect. Follow up with “I’m glad I asked; let me try that again.”

5. When seeking to understand someone’s motives and intent, inquire genuinely without judgment. Avoid asking “why” questions, as they provoke defensiveness. Instead ask what, when, where, and how to gain insight into their perspective.

6. Don’t use phrases like “I feel that” or “I feel like,” as these often lead to statements rather than emotional expressions. Instead, use “I feel” followed by an actual feeling word. This simple change is more likely to result in a connection with the other person."

9. When They Lose Momentum
↳ Instead of ""They must not be motivated.""
↳ Say ""Have we challenged, coached, and empowered them properly?""

10. When Evaluating Your Sales Culture
↳ Instead of ""Are my reps working hard?""
↳ Say ""Is our system setting them up to win?""

Bram Swinnen,https://be.linkedin.com/in/bram-swinnen-685659229?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Integrated brain training is a real game-changer for ACL rehab.

🤔 In sports, athletes perform in dynamic, unpredictable settings, making split-second decisions while executing complex movements. That's a far cry from the controlled environment of typical rehab sessions. 

💡 Rehab focuses on task-oriented exercises and internal feedback, but it might be missing the mark. From recent research it even seems that classic rehabilitation induces as much, if not more, of the neuroplasticity than the injury itself, increasing the risk of re-injury (Grooms, in press).
 
🏋️♀️ There’s a need for an implicit and dual-task approach in ACL rehab, starting from the early stages.
The video highlights the integration of this approach into ACL rehab.
 
🔴 SL squat right leg; Pass left; Count -1. 
🟢 Step-up right leg; Pass left; Count +1. 
🟣 SL RDL right leg; Count -2. 
🔵 SL squat left; Header. 
🟡 Step-up left leg; Header; Count +2. 
🩵 SL RDL left leg.
 
1️⃣ Neuromuscular deficits and muscle weakness occur at different central nervous system levels (Cortical, subcortical and spinal level) in ACL patients (Tayfur 2020, Bodkin 2019). These deficits in central activation are linked to poor recuperation of quadriceps activation and strength (Criss 2023). These neural deficits not only prevent effective strengthening, but also contribute to secondary injury risk (Capin 2016).
Impaired strength and central nervous system excitability persist for months to years after ACL surgery, suggesting the need for integrated brain training during the early stages of ACL rehab (Kuenze 2015). Traditional concentric exercises cannot overcome the inhibited cortical drive to the muscle and therefore fails to adequately activate muscles and restore neuromuscular control (Lepley 2015).
 
 
2️⃣ There's a link between how our brains work and the risk of ACL injuries. Brain activity related to visual, proprioceptive and attentional integration are crucial factors in rehab and prevention of ACL injury (Grooms 2022).
Interestingly, athletes with high-risk landing biomechanics following ACL rehab exhibit a brain activation pattern shifted toward increased visual-proprioceptive and spatial processing to organize movement. However, this heightened reliance on attentional and sensory processing for movement coordination might compromise their ability to effectively maintain neuromuscular control in high-pressure sports situations involving opponents or the ball (common scenarios for ACL injuries) (Villa 2020)

The current task-oriented rehab methods might actually reinforce these less effective brain activation patterns rather than fixing them. It is paramount to design rehab programs that challenge both the body and the brain, simulating the unpredictable situations athletes face during games. By integrating tasks that require perception, quick decision-making and neuromuscular control, we are able to retrain the brain and reduce the risk of injuries (Chaaban 2023, Grooms 2017).

Chris Walker,https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswalker171?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Old Way = Look at the Sales funnel by department
New Way = Look at the Sales funnel by buyer intent (how the buyer entered the sales funnel)

Historically, each department is measured by the blended performance of the “leads” they source with direct software-attribution. This model incentives getting the most “leads” and the lowest cost, not to drive *revenue & and sales productivity.

Marketing runs lead gen to first-touch attribution on as many contacts as possible to game attribution. It doesn’t actually drive customers to want to buy but appeases their outdated attribution models circa 2012.

Planning and forecasting breaks down because they blend content syndication leads that close at 0.1% with declared intent demo requests that win at 8%. Their old school “demand waterfall” model breaks like cheap glass.

Departments (Sales, Marketing, SDRs) fight over credit instead of working together because that’s how teams are measured and budgets are set.

It’s such an outdated model and a core driver of sales/marketing misalignment and other overall GTM problems.

Smart companies want to adopt an “All-Bound” model because they see this clear problem in their business, but need a new framework to measure success & make strategy adjustments.

Here’s how to make it happen:

1. Look at what GTM motion CAPTURED the demand (what was the trigger for how the buyer entered the pipeline). These are called “pipeline sources”.

2. These pipeline sources are a surrogate for **buyer intent** and will much better predict sales efficiency metrics like win rate, sales cycle length, and pipeline velocity.

3. Build a separate attribution model (e.g. self-reported attribution) to characterize what programs are CREATING the demand.

4. Use this data to OPTIMIZE your entire revenue strategy, not determine binary credit to teams, departments, and budgets.

Implementing this framework will:

1. Drive significantly better alignment between all GTM teams

2. Have all teams WORKING TOGETHER, not fighting each other for “credit”

3. Create an entirely new view for Revenue leaders and strategists to make far better decisions & strategy improvements

4. Dramatically improve your revenue planning and forecasting accuracy.

5. Clearly show you where to FOCUS and clearly show you what to STOP doing.

It’s 2023. Every department (Sales, Marketing, SDRs, Customer Success, etc.) contributes to every closed won customer.

Because of this, B2B companies need to establish a holistic, objective, comprehensive view of their entire GTM performance.

Deepali Vyas,https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepalivyas?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"If your one-on-ones are primarily status updates, you're missing a massive opportunity to build trust, develop talent, and drive real results.

After working with countless leadership teams across industries, I've found that the most effective managers approach 1:1s with a fundamentally different mindset...

They see these meetings as investments in people, not project tracking sessions.

Great 1:1s focus on these three elements:

1. Support: 
Create space for authentic conversations about challenges, both professional and personal. When people feel safe discussing real obstacles, you can actually help remove them.

Questions to try: 
""What's currently making your job harder than it needs to be?"" 
""Where could you use more support from me?""

2. Growth: 
Use 1:1s to understand aspirations and build development paths. People who see a future with your team invest more deeply in the present.

Questions to explore: 
""What skills would you like to develop in the next six months?"" 
""What parts of your role energize you most?""

3. Alignment: 
Help team members connect their daily work to larger purpose and meaning. People work harder when they understand the ""why"" behind tasks.

Questions that create alignment: 
""How clear is the connection between your work and our team's priorities?"" 
""What part of our mission resonates most with you personally?""

By focusing less on immediate work outputs and more on the human doing the work, you'll actually see better performance, retention, and results.

Priyanka Rakshit,https://in.linkedin.com/in/priyanka-rakshit-personalbrandingexpert?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"You don’t need 100k followers to build a wildly successful personal brand.

I recently spoke to a coach who earns over ₹8L/mo from her online presence.
No ads.
No paid funnels.
Not even daily content.

Just a simple but powerful system that brings in high-quality clients consistently.

She has around 18K followers in total.
But here’s the magic: almost all of her clients come through content + referrals.
Let me break it down for you 👇

1. High-Value, Results-Focused Offer
She’s a business coach, but instead of being vague, she helps people launch and scale group programs (which brings recurring revenue for her clients).

That means her service delivers clear, financial ROI.
She isn’t just offering “clarity” or “mindset”, she’s solving a specific problem with measurable outcomes.

Because of that, her clients stay longer. Some even work with her for 6+ months.
And just one client can bring her ₹1.5-2 lakhs over time.

➡️ Lesson: Clarity in your offer = higher client value + more referrals.

2. Trust-Building Content
This is her superpower.

She doesn’t just post fluff or tips.

She shares:
Case studies of clients filling up their group programs
Screenshots of feedback from live calls
Simple behind-the-scenes of her process

People trust her not because she shouts the loudest, 
but because she shows real proof consistently.

➡️ Trust > virality, always.

3. Value-First Content
Once or twice a week, she drops short, snackable tips:

✅ A simple DM script that helped her land 5 discovery calls
✅ Her 3-step framework for filling up masterclasses
✅ Mistakes she sees new coaches make (and how to fix them)

These posts don’t always go viral.
But they’re shared, bookmarked, and make people say: “I learned something.”

That’s the kind of value that builds brand recall.

4. Subtle Differentiation
She doesn't bash other coaches.

She simply positions her offer in a clear, differentiated way:
""I don’t just help you attract leads, I help you convert them with zero ads and zero burnout.""

That line alone is a brand differentiator.

➡️ It’s not just about being different. It’s about being usefully different.

5. Her Secret Sauce: Referrals + DMs
She has a small but engaged circle.

And she shows up intentionally.

She replies to DMs. She sends voice notes. She checks in with past clients.

And she offers free 15-min strategy checks in exchange for referrals.

Because she’s easy to trust and easy to recommend,
she gets consistent warm leads, no cold pitching needed.

The Big Truth?
You don’t need a big following.
You need a clear offer, real proof, and a repeatable system to build trust.

If you're a coach trying to grow your personal brand and client base..
Start here. Nail this. And you won’t need to chase the algorithm ever again.

P.S. If you want to set this up for yourself, I created a free 5-day guide that helps you fix your profile, create content, and attract real leads from LinkedIn without wasting hours.
Drop a “5 DAY” and I’ll DM it to you."

→ Every prompt and response is logged, audited, and cost-attributed.
→ Hallucination detection, PII filters, bias audits — enforced by default.
→ LLMs accessed only through a centralized AI gateway.

4. 𝗙𝘂𝗹𝗹-𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗼𝗯𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆
→ Centralized logging, analytics, and monitoring across all solutions
→ Built-in lifecycle governance, FinOps, and Responsible AI enforcement
→ Secure onboarding of use cases and private data controls
→ Enables policy adherence across infrastructure, models, and apps

5. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻-𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗲 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀
→ Modular setup for user interface, business logic, and orchestration
→ Integrated agents, prompt engineering, and model APIs
→ Guardrails, feedback systems, and observability built into the solution
→ Delivered through the AI Gateway for consistent compliance and scale

Andrew Ng,https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Last week, I described four design patterns for AI agentic workflows that I believe will drive significant progress: Reflection, Tool use, Planning and Multi-agent collaboration. Instead of having an LLM generate its final output directly, an agentic workflow prompts the LLM multiple times, giving it opportunities to build step by step to higher-quality output. Here, I'd like to discuss Reflection. It's relatively quick to implement, and I've seen it lead to surprising performance gains. 

You may have had the experience of prompting ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini, receiving unsatisfactory output, delivering critical feedback to help the LLM improve its response, and then getting a better response. What if you automate the step of delivering critical feedback, so the model automatically criticizes its own output and improves its response? This is the crux of Reflection. 

Take the task of asking an LLM to write code. We can prompt it to generate the desired code directly to carry out some task X. Then, we can prompt it to reflect on its own output, perhaps as follows:

Here’s code intended for task X:
[previously generated code]
Check the code carefully for correctness, style, and efficiency, and give constructive criticism for how to improve it.

Sometimes this causes the LLM to spot problems and come up with constructive suggestions. Next, we can prompt the LLM with context including (i) the previously generated code and (ii) the constructive feedback, and ask it to use the feedback to rewrite the code. This can lead to a better response. Repeating the criticism/rewrite process might yield further improvements. This self-reflection process allows the LLM to spot gaps and improve its output on a variety of tasks including producing code, writing text, and answering questions.

And we can go beyond self-reflection by giving the LLM tools that help evaluate its output; for example, running its code through a few unit tests to check whether it generates correct results on test cases or searching the web to double-check text output. Then it can reflect on any errors it found and come up with ideas for improvement.

Further, we can implement Reflection using a multi-agent framework. I've found it convenient to create two agents, one prompted to generate good outputs and the other prompted to give constructive criticism of the first agent's output. The resulting discussion between the two agents leads to improved responses.

Reflection is a relatively basic type of agentic workflow, but I've been delighted by how much it improved my applications’ results. If you’re interested in learning more about reflection, I recommend:

Aaron Levie,https://www.linkedin.com/in/boxaaron?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"A big question in software is what happens to the systems of record in a world of AI Agents. Do they go away? Do they just become databases? Or do they become more powerful?

I’d argue that they’re just as powerful as ever, if not more powerful, in a world of 100X more interactions with software. 

The purpose of your system of record (whether it’s ERP, CRM, ITSM, or a document management system) is to hold the data and manage the workflows around the most important areas of your business: your customer commitments, leads, revenue figures, inventory, IP, product research, supply chain, and more.

Importantly, you want the data and workflows in these systems operate in deterministic ways. When you ask a question like “what is my revenue,” you need the precise answer. When you move a lead from one stage to another, you can’t afford for it to get dropped. When you update your inventory, you can’t have it change inadvertently. Getting the data, permissions, access controls, business logic, and workflows right, every single time, is critical.

On the other hand, AI Agents operate in a world of non-deterministic actions. What makes them so powerful is they can adapt to entirely new instructions on the fly, use judgment to perform actions, and operate on troves of unstructured information and decisions. When you ask an AI Agent to research and summarize a set of documents, it will produce a slightly different answer every single time - and in most use-cases for AI Agents, this is a feature, not a bug.

Just as you wouldn’t ask the world’s smartest human to memorize every piece of inventory you have, or all of the permissions of every information that employees should have access (with their specific access controls) to, you similarly won’t ask AI Agents to do that in the future.

This is where the separation of duties comes into play. AI Agents will be doing non-deterministic actions (like generating a sales plan, responding to a customer, or writing code), and deterministic systems will be for remembering those actions and incorporating them across a variety of workflows. 

In fact, in a world of AI Agents running around doing autonomous tasks 24/7, in parallel, and at unlimited scale, the role that these systems of record play will likely be even more important. Getting this relationship down is going to be key to the future of the enterprise IT stack."

Here’s how it works:
1. Your prompt fans out to multiple models
▸ GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, whatever you add.
▸ Each model answers the same query independently. No shared context. No coordination. Pure first-pass reasoning.

2. Then the models see each other’s answers
▸ All responses are revealed to every model, anonymized.
▸ No one knows who wrote what.
▸ This removes brand bias and forces actual evaluation.

3. Every model becomes a critic
Each model:
 → ranks the answers
 → flags mistakes
 → explains weaknesses
 → highlights better reasoning

This gives you per-query evaluation instead of a static benchmark.

4. A Chairman model makes the final call
It gets:
▸ all answers
▸ all rankings
▸ all critiques

Then it produces one final response by merging the strongest reasoning and correcting the errors exposed by the council.

This is routing based on evidence, not vibes.

5. You see one clean output
▸ The UI looks like ChatGPT.
▸ Under the hood: workers → critics → synthesis.

A simple, transparent LLM router that judges models on each task, instead of asking you to trust a single guess."

Jyoti Bansal,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jyotibansal?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"It's astonishing that $180 billion of the nearly $600 billion on cloud spend globally is entirely unnecessary. For companies to save millions, they need to focus on these 3 principles — visibility, accountability, and automation.

1) Visibility  

The very characteristics that make the cloud so convenient also make it difficult to track and control how much teams and individuals spend on cloud resources.

Most companies still struggle to keep budgets aligned. The good news is that a new generation of tools can provide transparency. For example: resource tagging to automatically track which teams use cloud resources to measure costs and identify excess capacity accurately.

2) Accountability

Companies wouldn't dare deploy a payroll budget without an administrator to optimize spend carefully. Yet, when it comes to cloud costs, there's often no one at the helm.

Enter the emerging disciplines of FinOps or cloud operations. These dedicated teams can take responsibility of everything from setting cloud budgets and negotiating favorable controls to putting engineering discipline in place to control costs.

3) Automation 

Even with a dedicated team monitoring cloud use and need, automation is the only way to keep up with the complex and evolving scenarios.

Much of today's cloud cost management remains bespoke and manual, In many cases, a monthly report or round-up of cloud waste is the only maintenance done — and highly paid engineers are expected to manually remove abandoned projects and initiatives to free up space. 

It’s the equivalent of asking someone to delete extra photos from their iPhone each month to free up extra storage. 

That’s why AI and automation are critical to identify cloud waste and eliminate it.

For example: tools like ""intelligent auto-stopping"" allow users to stop their cloud instances when not in use, much like motion sensors can turn off a light switch at the end of the workday.

As cloud management evolves, companies are discovering ways to save millions, if not hundreds of millions — and these 3 principles are key to getting cloud costs under control."

I came across Ameru’s AI Smart Bin — and it made me realize something we rarely talk about in sustainability:
We don’t fail to recycle because we don’t care. We fail because the friction is too high.

It sees what you throw, sorts it automatically, and even gives you real-time feedback.
The results?
✅ 95%+ sorting accuracy
✅ Analytics that show you how to reduce waste
✅ ROI in under 2 years

👉 Here’s the hidden insight:
Let’s be honest: recycling is broken.
Most of us want to recycle, but the system is designed for failure — too much friction, too many rules. The real innovation isn’t in AI or edge computing. It’s in making sustainability invisible. No guilt, no extra steps — just default behavior upgraded. 

💡 Actionable thought: Whether you’re building tech, a product, or even a habit, ask yourself — how can I make the right choice feel effortless?
Because effort scales linearly. But effortlessness? That scales exponentially.

PS: Imagine when every trash bin becomes a data point in the circular economy.

I just watched another rep lose a ""sure thing"" deal. Had budget, authority, need, timeline... all the BANT boxes checked. Still lost.

Here's the problem: BANT tells you if someone CAN buy. It doesn't tell you if they WILL buy.

Same with MEDDIC. Better than BANT, but it's still focused on what WE need to qualify them, not how THEY actually make buying decisions.

So I created something different. The ADVANCED method that was inspired by Nate Nasralla.

A - Acknowledged Problem 
D - Documented Issue
V - Validated by Team 
A - Authorized by Executive 
N - Narrowed to External 
C - Chosen as Vendor 
E - Established Timeline 
D - Deal Terms Finalized

This isn't another qualification framework. This is how complex B2B buyers actually progress through their decision making process.

I break down all 8 stages in the carousel below, but here's why this works:
Each stage has predictable win rates.

Stage 0-1 deals close at 10-20%. Stage 6-7 deals close at 80-90%.
Unlike other frameworks, ADVANCED tracks buyer behavior, not seller activities. It shows you exactly how deep you are in THEIR process.

I even updated my entire pipeline to match this framework. Now I know the real probability of every deal closing... not just my gut feeling.

Most importantly? It tells you what needs to happen next. No more guessing.

If you're tired of ""sure thing"" deals that never close, maybe it's time to track what actually matters.

Stop measuring what's convenient for you. Start measuring how your buyers actually buy.

BTW. Can you honestly say where each of your deals stands using these 8 stages? If not, you're flying blind.

The best reps know exactly where they stand. Now you can too.

Normally industries prefer steel structure to house their production and infrastructure units. They take less time for fabrication and erection, they are stubborn and strong as compared to concrete structures and they are also convenient for maintenance.

However when they are corroded or start losing their structural parameters, then they are left with couple of options. One is to replace them and another is to rehabilitate them. Replacing them is a convenient option but it calls for stopping all the activities happening over the structure which might be a loss of production for a process industry. It is also a part of depletion of natural resource - metal ore' which must be avoided.

When the option of their rehabilitation is sought, the first and most important activity in this direction is to carry out the actual assessment of damages by non destructive or partial destructive method. These methods are listed below.

1.     Ultrasonic thickness measurement test,
This test measures actual thickness of the section which can be compared with the original thickness and reduction in thickness if any – can be known.

2.     Magnetic particle test,
This test indicates disturbance in micro particles of the metal matrix if any which can again be compared with the original molecular structure of the metal member to arrive at the variance if any.

3.     Microstructure analysis,
Here the metal member is observed under 600x magnification under radioactive source which helps to know the granular structure of the metal member.

4.     Dye Penetration test,
This test highlights crevices and fishers if developed within the metal member.

5.     Themography test,
This is an advance test which indentifies hot zone and cold zone within metal matrix. The thermal representation of test result can be correlated with internal damage of metal member in lamination pattern.

6.     Radiography.
As the name suggests, radioactive waves are passed through metal member to know complete details of internal structure of the metal member. This test can cause radioactive infection so it is done within ‘no man’s land’.

Test results are then to be comprehensively interpreted and evaluated to arrive at the deficiency developed within the metal member. More often than not the help of reverse engineering is taken to quantify the deficiency and actual parameters in which augmentation required to be done. Accordingly the rehabilitation scheme for corroded or under-performing structural steel structure can be designed and executed at site. Pictures of highly corroded / deteriorated structures tell everything about the possible damages."

T & C is an important step and process to be performed in order to make sure that the system is functioning well before it starts generating electricity. It helps to ensure that the system is safe, efficient, and ready to use.

✅️ Types of Testing

1. Visual Inspection: This is the first step where technical engineers look at the entire system. They check for any obvious issues like loose wires, damaged panels, or improper installation.

2. Electrical Testing: This includes checking the electrical connections and making sure everything is wired correctly. Technical engineers measure voltage, current, and resistance to ensure they meet safety standards.

3. Performance Testing: Here, the system is monitored under real conditions to see how well it generates electricity. This helps to ensure that the system is producing the expected amount of power.

4. Safety Testing: Safety is important in any electrical system. Technical engineers perform tests to ensure that there are no risks of electric shocks or fires. This includes checking grounding systems and circuit breakers.

5. Thermal Imaging: This test uses special cameras to detect hot spots on solar panels and electrical components. Hot spots can indicate problems that need fixing.

✅️ IEC Standards

The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) sets global standards for electrical equipment, including solar PV systems. These standards ensure that systems are safe and reliable. Some key IEC standards for solar PV include:

- IEC 61215: This standard covers the design qualification and type approval of crystalline silicon solar panels. It ensures they can withstand various environmental conditions.

- IEC 61730: This standard focuses on the safety of solar modules, ensuring they are safe to use and won’t pose any hazards.

- IEC 62109: This standard deals with the safety of power converters used in solar systems, making sure they operate safely under different conditions.

Shivi Mishra,https://in.linkedin.com/in/shivi-mishra-2218a2223?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"How We Started Bug Management at takeUforward 🚀  

In any budding startup, especially when you're building everything from scratch as a bunch of college students with no prior professional experience, managing user feedback and bugs can be chaotic.  

From day one, we gave our users the option to report bugs while using the website, ensuring a better user experience. But with a growing user base, we soon realized that managing all bug reports and feature requests in one place was becoming overwhelming. Each user had a unique request -> some system-specific bugs, others feature suggestions. As a service provider, resolving these issues was our responsibility because, at the end of the day, ""customer obsession is the only trend that matters"" (though, let’s be real, not every customer is meant to be obsessed with😃).  

🫡 #TheChallenge: Efficiently Assigning & Resolving Bugs  
With a small team divided into problem setters, video editors, developers, editorial writers, and those handling miscellaneous tasks, we needed a seamless way to ensure reported issues reached the right person. Initially, we integrated ClickUp to automate task creation, assignments, and progress updates. But something was missing—users needed a direct way to communicate with us without the formality (and hassle) of email updates!

👾 #TheSolution: An Internal Bug Management Portal  
To streamline everything, I built an internal portal to:  
✅ Monitor reported bugs across different sections  
✅ Filter bugs based on priority & report time  
✅ Track resolution time and last updates  
✅ Allow direct communication with users via comments  

It took me a week of development time to build this (don’t judge the UI—it’s minimal and purely functional for internal use), but the impact has been huge:  
🔹 Bugs in single digits: at any given time  
🔹 Average resolution time: 48-60 hours 
🔹 Every reported issue reaches us directly, and we respond firsthand  

This might seem like a basic operation from a developer's perspective, but for our team, it has transformed the way we handle user feedback. Small internal projects like these don’t just improve efficiency, they enhance user trust and satisfaction.  

Building things fast, iterating faster; that’s the startup way. 🚀"

While automation tools can simulate human actions, they don't possess human instincts to react to various situations. Understanding the limitations of automation is crucial to avoid blaming the tool for our own scripting shortcomings.

📌 Encountering Unexpected Errors:
Automation tools cannot handle scenarios like intuitively handling error messages or auto-resuming test cases after failure. Testers must investigate execution reports, refer to screenshots or logs, and provide precise instructions to handle unexpected errors effectively.

📌 Test Data Management:
Automation testing relies heavily on test data. Ensuring the availability and accuracy of test data is vital for reliable testing. Testers must consider how the automation script interacts with the test data, whether it retrieves data from databases, files, or APIs. Additionally, generating test data dynamically can enhance test coverage and provide realistic scenarios.

📌 Dynamic Elements and Timing:
Web applications often contain dynamic elements that change over time, such as advertisements or real-time data. Testers need to use techniques like dynamic locators or wait to handle these dynamic elements effectively. Timing issues, such as synchronization problems between application responses and script execution, can also impact test results and require careful consideration.

📌 Maintenance and Adaptability:
Automation scripts need regular maintenance to stay up-to-date with application changes. As the application evolves, UI elements, workflows, or data structures might change, causing scripts to fail. Testers should establish a process for script maintenance and ensure scripts are adaptable to accommodate future changes.

📌 Test Coverage and Risk Assessment:
Automation testing should not aim for 100% test coverage in all scenarios. Testers should perform risk assessments and prioritize critical functionalities or high-risk areas for automation. Balancing automation and manual testing is crucial for achieving comprehensive test coverage.

📌 Test Environment Replication:
Replicating the test environment ensures that the automation scripts run accurately and produce reliable results. Testers should pay attention to factors such as hardware, software versions, configurations, and network conditions to create a robust and representative test environment.

📌 Continuous Integration and Continuous Testing:
Integrating automation testing into a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline can accelerate the software development lifecycle. Automation scripts can be triggered automatically after each code commit, providing faster feedback on the application's stability and quality.

Let's go beyond just clicking a button and embrace automation testing as a strategic tool for software quality and efficiency.

Bad bug reports are worse than no reports.

They create chaos, kill time, and stall launches.

I learned this the hard way at a healthcare company.

A blood bank release. High stakes. Time-sensitive.

Then—one vague bug appeared just before launch.

“Form not working. Urgent.”

No steps. No context. No response from the tester.

  
We waited 18 hours for a reply.
 
The entire team was stuck. Discussions went in circles.

 All because one report lacked clarity.

The real issue?

 Poor writing made action impossible.

💡 Want to write reports that help?

Here’s a checklist every defect report should include:

✅ Clear summary – What’s wrong in one line

✅ Steps to reproduce – Easy, exact steps

✅ Expected vs. actual – What should vs. what did
 
✅ Priority & severity – Impact clearly defined
 
✅ Environment – OS, device, version, etc.
  
✅ Screenshots or logs – Show, don’t just tell
 
✅ Component/module – Where it happened
 
✅ Assignee & reporter – Who’s handling what
 
✅ Version/sprint – When it was found
 
✅ Linked issues/comments – Extra context

🚀 Clear bugs lead to faster fixes.
 
💥 Vague bugs? They break your team.

Bharat Varshney,https://in.linkedin.com/in/bharatvarshney?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"After mentoring 50+ QA professionals and collaborating across cross-functional teams, I’ve noticed a consistent pattern:

 Great testers don’t just find bugs faster — they identify patterns of failure faster.

The biggest bottleneck isn’t just in writing test cases.
 It’s in the 10-15 minutes of uncertainty, thinking: What should I validate here? Which testing approach fits best?

Here’s my Pattern Recognition Framework for QA Testing 

1. Test Strategy Mapping
 Keywords:“new feature”, “undefined requirements”, “early lifecycle”
 Use when feature is still evolving — pair with Product/Dev, define scope, test ideas, and risks collaboratively.

2. Boundary Value & Equivalence Class
 Keywords: “numeric input”, “range validation”, “min/max”, “edge cases”
 Perfect for form fields, data constraints, and business rules. Spot breakpoints before users do.

3. Exploratory Testing
 Keywords: “new flow”, “UI revamp”, “unusual user behavior”, “random crashes”
 Ideal when specs are incomplete or fast feedback is required. Let intuition and product understanding lead.

4. Regression Testing
 Keywords: “old functionality”, “code refactor”, “hotfix deployment”
 Always triggered post-deployment or sprint-end. Automate for stability, manually validate for confidence.

5. API Testing (Contract + Behavior)
 Keywords: “REST API”, “status codes”, “response schema”, “integration bugs”
 Use when backend is decoupled. Postman, Postbot, REST Assured — pick your tool, validate deeply.

6. Performance & Load
 Keywords: “slowness”, “timeout”, “scaling issue”, “traffic spike”
 JMeter, k6, or BlazeMeter — simulate real user load and catch bottlenecks before production does.

7. Automation Feasibility
 Keywords: “repeated scenarios”, “stable UI/API”, “smoke/sanity”
 Use Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, or hybrid frameworks — focus on ROI, not just coverage.

8. Log & Debug Analysis
 Keywords: “not reproducible”, “backend errors”, “intermittent failures”
 Dig into logs, inspect API calls, use browser/network tools — find the hidden patterns others miss.

9. Security Testing Basics
 Keywords: “user data”, “auth issues”, “role-based access”
 Check if roles, tokens, and inputs are secure. Include OWASP mindset even in regular QA sprints.

10. Test Coverage Risk Matrix
 Keywords: “limited time”, “high-risk feature”, “critical path”
 Map test coverage against business risk. Choose wisely — not everything needs to be tested, but the right things must be.

11.Shift-Left Testing (Early Validation)
Keywords: “user stories”, “acceptance criteria”, “BDD”, “grooming phase”
 Get involved from day one. Collaborate with product and devs to prevent defects, not just detect them.

 Why This Matters for QA Leaders?
Faster bug detection = Higher release confidence
Right testing approach = Less flakiness & rework
Pattern recognition = Scalable, proactive QA culture

When your team recognizes the right test strategy in 30 seconds instead of 10 minutes — that’s quality at speed, not just quality at scale"
Grant Lee,https://www.linkedin.com/in/grantslee?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"""Is $20/month too much for our product?""

Instead of guessing, we used the Van Westendorp method to find our pricing sweet spot.

4 questions revealed exactly what users would pay (and we haven't touched our pricing since).

Here's the framework any founder can steal:

1. Send a survey to actual users, not prospects

We surveyed people already using Gamma. They understood the real value of our product, not hypothetical value.

Too many founders survey their waitlist or randomly select people who have never used their product. That's like asking someone who's never driven about car prices.

2. Ask these 4 specific questions

- At what price would this be too expensive for you to consider it?
- At what price is it expensive but still delivering value?
- At what price does it feel like a bargain?
- At what price is it so cheap you'd question if it's reliable?

These create bookends for perceived value. You're mapping the entire spectrum of price psychology, not just asking ""what would you pay?""

3. Plot the responses and find where the lines intersect

Graph responses from lots of users. Where ""too expensive"" and ""too cheap"" lines cross: that's your acceptable range. Where ""expensive but fair"" meets ""bargain"": this is your optimal price point.

4. Test within the range, don't just pick the middle

The intersection gives you a range, not a number. We ran pricing experiments within that range to see actual conversion rates. A survey shows willingness to pay; testing reveals actual behavior.

5. Lean towards generous (especially for product-led growth)

We chose to be more generous with AI usage than our ""optimal"" price suggested. Word-of-mouth growth matters more than maximizing initial revenue. Not everything shows up in the numbers.

6. Lock it in and stop tinkering

Once you find the sweet spot through data, stick with it. We haven't changed pricing in 2 years. Every month debating pricing is a month not improving product.

Remember: pricing is a signal, not just a number

This is the story of how UNIQLO, a Japanese clothing giant, chose to swim against the tide-when most global fashion brands in India rushed to list on Amazon or Flipkart, UNIQLO boldly said no to the biggest marketplaces. 

Launched in 2019, UNIQLO earned ₹139 crore in its first year. Fast forward to FY23, they’ve grown 4X, proving their unique strategy works.

Here’s how they did it:

📌They chose to stay off Amazon and Flipkart, focusing on its app and website to control its brand and customer experience.

📌Compared to other fast fashion brands like H&M or Zara, UNIQLO’s products often come with a higher price tag. But they justify it through superior quality, timeless designs, and innovative materials (like HEATTECH and AIRism)

📌While fast fashion giants rely on aggressive sales and discounts, UNIQLO focuses on trust, slow but steady growth, and loyalty. 

From opening in Delhi in 2019 to 15 stores across India today, UNIQLO uses data to expand where it matters, rather than chasing scale. I managed to visit their stores during my trip to Japan and truly amazed at the experience at the store as well comfort of the products.

Alpana Razdan,https://in.linkedin.com/in/alpanarazdaan?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"The teen models in Mango's latest campaign have perfect poses, perfect lighting, and one small detail: they don't exist.

This Spanish fashion giant launched their Sunset Dream collection using entirely AI-generated models across 95 markets. Not a single human model was photographed.

Here's how they did it:

📌 Took photos of real clothes on display stands
📌 Fed these pictures to their AI system
📌 Created model images in minutes
📌 Rolled out everywhere at once

The business impact is massive. Fashion brands typically save 60-80% by leveraging AI photoshoots. Those savings can now fund innovation, better pricing, or faster expansion.

But cost isn't the real story here.

Speed is. While competitors wait weeks for campaign photos, MANGO creates, tests, and launches collections in days. No weather delays. No scheduling conflicts. No reshoots.

This wasn't luck. Since 2018, Mango has built 15 different AI platforms across their business. They've been preparing for this moment.

The result? Their 2024 turnover reached 3.3 billion euros in 2024, growing 7.6% from 2023.

What makes this significant is that Mango proved AI-generated content can drive real sales. Their teen customers embraced these virtual models without hesitation.

Fashion's biggest players are watching. If Mango's approach succeeds long-term, traditional photography could become a thing of the past for e-commerce.

The brands that adapt now will set industry standards. Those that don't might find themselves competing against companies moving at AI speed.

Fast fashion isn’t a fleeting trend, it’s a festering threat to our health, humanity, and home.

Hazardous chemicals used in the fabrics, unchecked exploitation of workers behind the seams, and environmental degradation that deepens with every discarded garment. It’s a cycle of consumption that poisons our planet, endangers the animals, and compromises our health.

By pumping up toxins, accelerating overproduction, underpaying and exploiting labour, and overlooking their long-term impact for short-term profit. 

Every stitch carries a story of suffering, and every bargain comes at a steep, hidden price that we pay for. 

But as consumers, we hold more power than we realise. Our choices can challenge these exploitative models, champion plantbased alternatives, and change the narrative from convenience to consciousness.

Exploring options like renting and thrifting allows us to enjoy diverse wardrobes without the environmental consequences or health risks. Because sustainable fashion doesn’t mean sacrificing style. 

Brands such as No Nasties, Sui, Okhai, The Summer House, and DOODLAGE in India, along with global names like tentree, Allbirds, and Pact, offer affordable, ethical, skin safe, and unique pieces you would be proud to wear too.

It's true — and I gave a whole presentation about it. I'm excited to share below the FULL case study I developed for a workshop last year, on the groundbreaking brand partnership between Jungle and WeTransfer for the ""Volcano"" album campaign.

As someone who typically focuses on tech industry trends, this case study was a rare opportunity for me to flex my muscles in marketing strategy. And there was truly no better subject for me than Jungle — who is one of my favorite live acts, and whose ""Volcano"" was my most-streamed album of last year.

An independent release on AWAL, ""Volcano"" currently boasts over 500 million Spotify streams, a Brit Award, and stellar music video choreography that would make even professional dancers envious. What many might not realize is that WeTransfer is credited as a producer on all 14 music videos for the album, as well as the full-length Volcano Motion Picture released in December 2023. WeTransfer timed this partnership with their own rebranding as a company, making Jungle the face of their key feature launches.

The campaign rolled out across multiple platforms over the course of 250+ days, with many exclusive content releases in Jungle's Medallion fan community, as well as on a bespoke, Jungle-branded WeTransfer landing page.

In the deck below, I break down:
🌋 The shape of Volcano's 254-day ""waterfall"" content release strategy, and how WeTransfer's role as a brand partner evolved throughout
🌋 Why WeTransfer and Jungle's brand aesthetics and audiences align
🌋 How the campaign catapulted Jungle's streaming and social media growth
🌋 How the campaign did NOT move the needle on brand awareness for WeTransfer — but still may have succeeded for the company in other ways
🌋 How to use tools like Chartmetric, Semrush, and SocialBlade to benchmark performance of similar campaigns across streaming, social media, and web traffic metrics

Disclaimer: This analysis only covers March–December 2023, so does not include Jungle's recent campaign with Gap, which had an even further impact on Jungle's streaming and social performance.

I *love* doing these data-driven music marketing breakdowns — especially for artists and scenes close to my heart — and would love to help other people out with this work. There's so much insight to be gained, even just from publicly available data.

""I don't search on Google for the things I can search on Amazon,"" a friend told me recently. 

The reason he gave literally defined what's happening in performance marketing today. 

""When I search for something on Google, I repeatedly see many ads for it and similar items everywhere. 

However, when I do the same on Amazon, I never get repeated ads.

That's why I always prefer searching on Amazon"".

This is so profound that it made me rethink my own browsing behavior.

To understand this better, you need to know two things.

1 ) When you search on Google, you end up going to the brand's direct website.
2) Amazon(even Flipkart) doesn't have Google or Facebook pixels on their site.

I hope you understand the reason.

If not, read on.

The moment you land on a product(D2C) website, Google and Facebook pixels on that website tag you as an in-market audience for that category. 

It will first start showing ads for that brand(remarketing) and then ads for other similar brands(PM campaigns).

This will continue until you move out of the in-market audience segment.

In the case of Amazon, when you search for a product, your information is only available within Amazon. (2)

So, you may see ads inside Amazon but not outside of it.

As a digital marketing person, I shouldn't say this.

But sometimes, it's ok to spill the beans."

In the early days of my career, brand loyalty was almost sacred. Consumers gravitated towards names they recognized—trusting them implicitly. But the landscape has shifted dramatically.


→ In 2024, private label sales in the U.S. surged by 3.9%, reaching a record $271 billion, outpacing the 1% growth of national brands.

→ In Europe, private labels now command nearly 40% of FMCG value share and approximately 62% of volume share across major markets like France, Germany, and the UK.

What's Driving This Shift?

→ Economic Pressures: With inflation impacting household budgets, consumers are seeking affordable alternatives without compromising on quality.
Oliver Wyman

→ Enhanced Quality: Modern private labels have evolved, offering products that rival national brands in both taste and performance.
The US Sun

→ Retailer Strategies: Companies like Walmart and Target are investing heavily in their private label lines, introducing brands like Bettergoods and Dealworthy, which have seen sales volumes increase by over 200% in 2024. 
Talk Business & Politics

Implications for FMCG Brands

→ Rethink Value Proposition: It's no longer just about brand recognition. Consumers are evaluating products based on quality, price, and alignment with their values.

→ Innovate Continuously: Stagnation is a risk. Brands must invest in R&D to stay ahead of evolving consumer preferences.

→ Strengthen Retail Partnerships: Collaborating closely with retailers can provide insights into consumer behavior and preferences, enabling brands to adapt more effectively.


The FMCG industry is undergoing a transformation. While brand heritage remains valuable, it's imperative to adapt to the changing dynamics. Emphasizing value, quality, and innovation will be key to staying relevant in this new era.

there’s a strong chance you’ll be pushed into early retirement by 52.
Not by choice—
but because the system will quietly stop picking your resume.
It’s sad.
It’s unfair.
But it’s very real.

I’ve been in leadership hiring for 25+ years.
And every time I forward a capable, experienced candidate aged 50+,
the response from HR is almost always the same:
“Let’s hold for now.”
“Maybe too senior for the role.”
 No response at all.

Meanwhile, reports say human life expectancy is increasing.
People are living longer, healthier lives.
But strangely, the professional shelf-life hasn’t moved an inch.
Why?

Because we’ve been conditioned to rely on our resumes to open doors.
But after a certain age, your resume alone stops working.
So how do you stay relevant?

If you want to keep getting hired after 50,
you must start building your network like your career depends on it—because it does.

Make people remember your name.
Be present in industry circles, offline and online.
Join forums, write, speak, mentor, and stay visible.
Build relationships where you are seen as a business enabler, not just a job seeker.

Because while HR may pause at your age,
decision-makers won’t—if they know you and trust your value.
This isn’t about being social.
 This is about survival.

The future belongs to those who are known, respected, and remembered.
Don’t wait for your resume to do the talking.

(And I didn’t even realize it.)

Tasks that should’ve taken 30 minutes dragged on for hours.
Blank screens. Zero motivation. Endless scrolling.

The problem wasn’t Time management.
It was 𝗙𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.

Then one day, I stumbled upon a 𝘔𝘦𝘥𝘪𝘶𝘮 article that listed a few unusual focus hacks.

I tried them. 
Tweaked them to fit my life.
Soon, I started showing up better. With clarity, not chaos.

Here’s what worked for me -
(If focus has been a struggle lately, this might just help.)

1. 𝗚𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗮 𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲
We often chase vague goals — deadlines, KPIs, praise.
But real energy comes when your work feels personal.

One day, I was stuck on a complex analysis. No motivation.
Then I pictured telling my mom what I did at work today.

Her smile. Her pride. That image changed everything.
Suddenly, it wasn’t just a task. It was something to be proud of.

➡ Ask yourself: “Who would I be excited to share this with?”
Picture their face. Then start the work.

2. 𝗢𝗻𝗲 𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗴. 𝗢𝗻 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗽. 𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗶𝘁.
It sounds odd, but looping one instrumental track helps me zone in.
I use Shri Hanuman Chalisa – Instrumental. No lyrics. Just rhythm.

In no time, my brain quiets down.
The repetition becomes an anchor:
“You’re working now. Stay here.”

➡ Pick a calm, lyric-free track. 
Hit repeat. 
Let it ground your attention.

3. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 2-𝗠𝗶𝗻𝘂𝘁𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝗧𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗸
Before starting a task, I set a 2-minute timer.
No typing. No scribbling. 
Just look at the task.

It’s like a warm-up for the brain.
You’re letting your mind settle into the work, not crash-land into it.

➡ Try this tomorrow. 
Just 2 min of stillness before starting.
You’ll be surprised how much smoother the task feels.

4. 𝗜 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁 𝗮 𝗙𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀 𝗚𝗿𝗮𝘃𝗲𝘆𝗮𝗿𝗱 
(𝘆𝗲𝘀, 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆)
Every time I get distracted during work hours, I don’t fight it.
I note it down in my phone’s Notes app.

• An unfinished Udemy course
• A half-watched YouTube video on AI agents
• The novel I abandoned after Chapter 7
• A call I owe to a childhood friend

It’s not about guilt — it’s about awareness.
A quiet system that tells me: 
“This is not urgent. It can wait.”

➡ Create a “Graveyard” note. Every time your mind wanders, log it.
Then return to your core task.

The Result?
I’m still a work in progress.
But I’m sharper. Quieter. Less reactive.

The Biggest Shift?
Not in my schedule, but in how I protect my attention.

REMEMBER -
You don’t need more hours.
You need fewer attention leaks.

In the fast-paced world of connectivity, deploying a telecom site (whether 4G or 5G) is a critical part of building reliable networks. From raw land to a fully functional base station, here’s a simplified but complete breakdown of what it takes:

🔹 1. Site Acquisition & Planning
- Identify suitable location based on coverage, capacity, and terrain analysis.
- Conduct Radio Frequency (RF) surveys and line-of-sight studies.
- Acquire land/rooftop rights, community consent, and building/zoning permits.
- Perform environmental and regulatory compliance checks.

🔹 2. Site Survey & Civil Works
- Perform site visits to inspect power access, grounding needs, and structural viability.
- Construct tower or rooftop mounts, equipment shelters, fencing, and earthing systems.
- Ensure backup power: batteries, rectifiers, or generators installed.

🔹 3. Equipment Installation
- Mount antennas, RRUs (Remote Radio Units), and feeders on the tower.
- Install indoor equipment (BBU, transmission, routers) in shelters or cabinets.
- Establish power supply, grounding, and environmental monitoring.

🔹 4. Transmission & Backhaul Setup
- Connect the site to the core network via fibre or microwave links.
- Perform alignment and Line Of Site (LOS) testing for microwave sites.
- Verify data throughput, latency, and failover mechanisms.

🔹 5. Integration & Commissioning
- Load configurations for baseband (eNodeB/gNodeB).
- Align antennas and test signal strength (VSWR, DTF, PIM).
- Integrate site into the core network (EPC or 5GC).
- Run drive tests and optimise KPIs (handover, RSRP, SINR).

🔹 6. Final Acceptance & Handover
- Conduct ATP (Acceptance Test Procedure) with operator/client.
- Finalise documentation: as-built drawings, test reports, and configs.
- Handover to operations team for monitoring and maintenance.

💡 Why This Process Matters
Each step ensures that voice calls connect instantly, data flows smoothly, and apps run seamlessly on every device from rural towns to urban hubs. A single site's reliability affects thousands of users.

Whether you're deploying one site or thousands, precision, compliance, and teamwork define success. 
Let’s continue building the future of connectivity one tower at a time. 🔧📶

Ehmad Zubair,https://pk.linkedin.com/in/ehmad-zubair?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"In 2023, I closed $600K for my agency without a sales team

Here’s how you can do it too

Hint: It's not about motivational quotes and morning routines

1. Less is More

- I focused on only one platform: Upwork.
- I submitted fewer, detailed proposals - Max. 2 per day.
- Every proposal included a video explaining how I’d solve the problem.

Contrary to what most “gurus” will tell you, you don’t need to send 100K emails every month. Focusing on your closing rate will get you more business and peace of mind.

2. Focus on a Niche

- I narrowed down my profile to target only 2 technologies: Django and React.
- I showcased projects with real results, focusing on outcomes, not just technology.
- I declined business outside of my expertise.

You are more likely to be seen as an expert when you work in a focused niche. Do a few things, but do them well!

3. Deliver Value to Existing Customers

- I focused on retaining customers before finding new ones.
- I underpromised and overdelivered.
- I asked my star customers for referrals - it only works if you ask

This led to a 30% yearly increase in business from existing customers. It's easier to sell more to current customers than to find new ones.

4. Do Things That Don’t Scale

- I built close relationships with customers, cared about their hobbies, families, and events.
- I held regular “feedback video calls” with every customer.

Your competition is probably not doing these unscalable things. Doing them shows your customers that you care about them and value them.

5. Measure and Optimize Ruthlessly

- I measured every step in the sales funnel.
- I fixed issues in the sales funnel; numbers don’t lie.
- I asked dropped leads why they didn’t choose us.

Never leave your sales decisions to chance. Even 20 leads can provide enough data to start making informed decisions. Measure everything.

Closing business in an agency is not about volume. It’s about efficiency. The good news is, once you’ve figured out your conversion numbers, it’s easy to hire, train, and replicate with even entry-level employees.

To all the founders and entrepreneurs working without a sales team

Keep going. It's tough, but you can do it

Rudra Karmakar,https://in.linkedin.com/in/rudrakarmakar?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Heads up, Salesforce Admins! 𝗪𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿 '𝟮𝟲 is changing how Flows run, and you need to be ready. 🚨

Big security changes are coming to Salesforce Flow this September. It's all about making sure users have the right permissions before they can run anything. No more free passes!

Here’s the simple breakdown of what’s changing:

1. You Must Now Give Users Specific Permission to Run Flows
𝗕𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲: A hidden setting gave many users a free pass to run Flows.
𝗡𝗼𝘄: You are in control. You must manually give each user or group the ""Run Flows"" permission through their Profile or a Permission Set, just like you would for editing a record or viewing a report.

2. Flows Can No Longer Bypass a User's Permissions
𝗕𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲: A Flow could sometimes edit records or fields that the user themselves didn't have access to, acting like a super-user.
𝗡𝗼𝘄: A Flow must play by the exact same rules as the person who triggered it. If a user can't edit an Account, then any Flow they run won't be able to edit that Account either. It's a strict enforcer of your security rules.

3. The ""Lockdown"" Setting is Automatically Turning On
𝗕𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲: There was an optional setting to ""Restrict Access"" to Flows that many orgs never turned on.
𝗡𝗼𝘄: Salesforce is automatically flipping this switch for everyone. This is the gatekeeper that enforces the new rules. If a user doesn't have the ""Run Flows"" permission, the gate slams shut and the Flow will not run.

What You Should Do NOW:
✅ Audit: Run a report to list all your active Flows. Which ones are critical?
✅ Permission Check: Who actually needs to run each Flow? Map it out.
✅ Test: Log in as a standard user (NOT an admin!) and test your key Flows. You might be surprised what breaks.
✅ Assign: Grant the ""Run Flows"" permission in Permission Sets for the right user groups.

This is a good change for security, but it will break things if you're not prepared. A little work now will save a major headache later!

David Funyi T.,https://cy.linkedin.com/in/david-funyi-t-56360389?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Controlling 10,000 drones with a single computer is a complex task that involves multiple technologies working together to manage communication, coordination, and flight operations effectively. 

Here are some key technologies that can be used to achieve this: 
 
 
Swarm Intelligence: Algorithms inspired by social insects like bees or ants can help coordinate and manage large numbers of drones to work together as a cohesive unit.  
 
Distributed Computing: Leveraging distributed computing allows processing tasks to be shared among drones, reducing the load on a single computer.  
 
Cloud Computing: Using cloud infrastructure can provide the computational power and storage needed to process large amounts of data and commands for the drones.  
 
Real-time Communication Protocols: Efficient protocols, such as MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) or DDS (Data Distribution Service), support low-latency communication between the control system and drones.  
 
Mesh Networking: This network topology enables drones to communicate with each other directly, forwarding data to extend range and reliability.  
 
AI and Machine Learning: AI algorithms can optimize flight paths and decision-making, enhancing the ability to manage large drone swarms.  
 
GPS and GNSS: These systems provide precise location data necessary for coordinating drone movements and ensuring they follow the correct paths.  
 
5G Connectivity: High-speed, low-latency networks like 5G can significantly improve communication between drones and the control computer.  
 
Edge Computing: Processing data on the drones themselves can reduce latency and bandwidth by only sending essential data back to the main control system.  
 
Autonomous Navigation Systems: Technologies such as SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) allow drones to navigate independently, reducing the control load.  
 
Simulation and Digital Twin Technology: These tools help model and plan drone missions effectively, optimizing performance and reducing risks before deployment.   
Integrating these technologies can enable effective management of large drone fleets, allowing for coordinated operations across various applications, from logistics to surveillance."
Saumya Singh,https://in.linkedin.com/in/saumya1singh?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Instead of purchasing a luxury car worth 2.1 Crores, I invested the same amount in property.

When I told my parents, that proud smile with teary eyes said it all. Years of effort, and small consistent steps had finally paid off.

I started my career journey by working in my dream product-based company. 

This was only possible because of the sharp domain knowledge + a good resume + a solid portfolio.

Since 2017 I have been exploring a lot of domains, doing small internships, teaching-assistant roles, freelancing, hackathons and what not. 

The truth in our industry is : your resume decides whether a human ever gets to know your story.

I’ve seen hundreds of resumes so far, from freshers, career switchers, and even people with 10+ years of experience.

And surprisingly, most of them fail before they even reach a recruiter because they can’t pass the ATS system. Harsh truth 💔

👉 You can actually check your ATS score (free) here: https://bit.ly/4hk3dGQ

Now if you want a successful career in tech or any competitive field, keep these underrated yet powerful resume tips in mind 👇

📍 Tip 1: Resume ≠ Biodata. It’s a marketing document.

Your resume’s goal isn’t to list everything you’ve done, it’s to convince someone to call you. Write like a storyteller, not a record keeper.

📍 Tip 2: Keywords = Visibility.

Every job description hides keywords (skills, tools, frameworks).
Use those exact terms naturally in your resume.
That’s how you pass the ATS filter and reach a real person.

📍 Tip 3: Numbers build trust.

Don’t say “Worked on improving performance.”
Say “Reduced API response time by 40%.”
Recruiters love data-backed impact.

📍 Tip 4: Tailor for every role.

If a company wants a Frontend Developer - your backend projects shouldn’t dominate the first half of your resume. Reorder and reframe your experience based on the role.

📍 Tip 5: Show evolution.

Add a “Career Highlights” or “Projects” section that shows how you’ve grown over time - it gives your journey context.

📍 Tip 6: Focus on readability.

Stick to one clean font (like Poppins or Open Sans), use consistent spacing, and save as a PDF. Looks professional and works across all systems.

📍 Tip 7: Link your portfolio or GitHub.

A single link showcasing your work says more than ten bullet points.
Make sure it’s updated and well-organized.

📍 Tip 8: Include a 2-line personal brand summary.
Something like :

“Software Engineer passionate about building scalable backend systems and mentoring early-career developers.”

📍 Tip 9: Add action words.

Use words like Built, Improved, Designed, Led, Optimized.
It shows initiative instead of obligation.

📍 Tip 10: Review like a recruiter.

Print it out or read it aloud- does it tell a clear, confident story in under 30 seconds?
If not, simplify.

Your resume is your first impression - Make sure it speaks before you ever do.

Hopefully you get your dream internship, job, project super soon ♥️"
Farhia N.,https://tz.linkedin.com/in/farhia-n-7a127b263?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"🚨 Why Are So Many African Startups Registered in Delaware, USA?
And why it should concern every African policymaker, entrepreneur, and ecosystem builder.

You’ve seen the headlines:

 “A Kenyan startup just raised $5M!”
But behind the scenes… that “Kenyan” startup is actually a Delaware C-Corp.



📊 In 2022, only 6% of African startups that raised $1M+ were registered in Africa.
The other 94%? Incorporated abroad — mostly in Delaware, USA.

Here’s why — and why it matters:

1️⃣ Investor Preference

Global investors (especially from the U.S. and Europe) want familiarity.
Delaware offers:

Strong investor protections

Clear legal precedents

Easy exits via IPO or acquisition


So African founders are forced to “flip” their companies to Delaware — not by choice, but to survive fundraising.

2️⃣ Legal Infrastructure

Delaware has:

Founder-friendly incorporation

Clean equity tools (stock options, SAFEs)

Simple VC due diligence

African legal systems? Not necessarily weak — just unfamiliar to global capital. And unfamiliar = risky.

3️⃣ Global Ambition

If you're building across Africa or aiming for a global exit, Delaware gives:

A base for raising from multiple jurisdictions

Legal comfort for U.S./EU acquirers

International credibility (on paper)

But here’s the downside:

❌ Capital flight
Millions raised under the name of “African startups” leave the continent immediately.
Offshore accounts. Offshore operations. Local economies see little return.

❌ Tax loss
Parent companies registered abroad often pay no corporate tax in Africa.
This starves local governments and widens inequality.

❌ Ecosystem fragility
Legal, tax, banking, and compliance expertise is built in Delaware, not Dakar.
Africa loses the chance to strengthen its own systems — and remains dependent.

🧠 Hard truth:

We celebrate funding rounds, but ignore the jurisdiction of control.
Africa is exporting its startups before they scale.

🚀 The Way Forward:

Pan-African legal frameworks that offer global-grade investor protections

AfCFTA-backed tech incorporation models

African VCs and sovereign funds that don’t require Delaware flips

Startup ecosystems that advocate for local registration with cross-border reach

💬 Let’s not just raise capital.
Let’s retain it, tax it, and build systems that serve Africans first.

Jussi Salovaara,https://sg.linkedin.com/in/jsalovaara?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"I’ve been watching Japan shift gears, and it’s impossible to ignore.

For a long time, Japan has risen above with process innovation and constant improvements, powering advanced manufacturing and world-class hardware.

But what it often struggled with was turning those deep process understandings and industry insights into revolutionary software or startups that could scale globally.

That narrative is starting to change, and it’s not by accident. It’s the result of a series of positive shifts that are finally aligning in the right direction:

1️⃣ First, there used to be a linguistic barrier that has long held Japanese startups back.

English is becoming more common in professional settings, and the rise of large language models is accelerating the shift.

This may not sound dramatic on its own, but it fundamentally changes the playing field. With this, founders can raise capital, recruit talent, and sell to overseas customers without hitting the same walls they used to face.

2️⃣ Second, the bridge with other ecosystems is maturing.

Japan is linking more deeply with regional ecosystems, moving beyond big corporations establishing strong presence in SEA over the past decade to now having startups from Singapore, Korea and Vietnam pitching and selling into Japan.

We saw this clearly at Antler Japan’s Demo Day in March, where startups from across APAC like fileAI, WhiRik AI Inc., Kubo Care Private Ltd, wrtn technologies, and bootloader studio pitched alongside Japanese founders.

This two-way natural collaboration is proving ground where Japanese startups can test global strategies in diverse markets before scaling further.

3️⃣ Third, there’s a mindset shift.

For decades, Japanese entrepreneurs focused inward, building for a domestic audience that was large enough to sustain growth on its own. But demographic challenges and economic pressures have pushed founders to think differently. 

Today, more Japanese startups are building with a “born global” approach, structuring their go-to-market strategies around regional expansion from the start.

This shift is reinforced by real government pushes and agencies like JETRO - Japan External Trade Organization are actively helping founders adopt a global mindset.

This is particularly exciting for Antler Japan.

With the right support, Japanese startups can now leap from their home market into Southeast Asia and beyond, carrying the rigor and discipline Japan is known for and applying it to a global customer base.

This is just the beginning. Japan’s startups are at an inflection point. Results will depend on execution, cultural shifts, and sustained support from both government and ecosystem players.

The pieces are falling into place, and the next generation of Japanese startups is being pushed into the right direction for global scale, by necessity and by opportunity.

The only question is who will be bold enough to break through the challenges, and fast enough to seize the moment."
Jenny Fielding,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennyfielding?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Every founder has a slide that says, “We’ll acquire customers through content marketing, paid social or partnerships.” And in 2025, nearly every investor has learned to ignore it 😿 

The old go-to-market playbooks are not working anymore. The channels are saturated, the costs are high and the returns are diminishing. From where I sit as an early stage investor, a generic GTM plan is no longer a sign of preparation - it’s a red flag. It shows a founder is ready to execute someone else’s old strategy, not discover a new unique one tailored to their own business.

Founders who are successful finding their first customers and raising capital are demonstrating something else entirely - not a polished plan, but a series of insightful discoveries.

Here’s what I see actually working to prove you can access a market:

✔️ A Portfolio of Scrappy Experiments. Before you can find a scalable channel, you need to prove you can find ANY channel. The most impressive founders show up with stories of things that don't scale. They acquired their first 50 users by building a free tool that solved a tiny problem for their target user or by personally engaging in a specific Subreddit or Slack community. This proves you have the creativity and grit to find customers where others aren’t even looking.

✔️ A Founder Who Is the Distribution Channel. Early on, your most powerful GTM advantage can’t be bought because it’s actually YOU. Investors are looking for a founder with a unique ability to reach the market. Are you an expert with a following in your industry? Have you built a deep, trusted network that represents your initial customer base? Show how your personal brand and unique insights give you an unfair advantage that no amount of ad spend or marketing can replicate.

✔️ Mastery of a ""Micro-Funnel."" Instead of a broad, leaky funnel, demonstrate that you can dominate a tiny, efficient one. Prove that you can convert a very specific persona from a very specific source with incredible efficiency. For example: ""We can turn a clinical research coordinator from a specific LinkedIn group into a qualified lead for $15."" This level of precision is far more impressive than a vague, top-down plan to capture a massive market. It shows you have a data-driven foundation from which to grow.

The goal of an early-stage GTM isn't to prove you can scale, it's to prove you can learn. Your first GTM strategy shouldn't be a playbook - it should be a lab notebook full of weird and (hopefully) winning experiments. 🙌🏼

Then they canceled three months later.

Sound familiar?
For many wineries, younger guests are showing up, having a great time… and dropping off the wine club just as fast.
It’s not because the experience wasn’t good. It’s because the model wasn’t made for them.

👉 Today’s under-40 crowd is subscription-fatigued, commitment-averse, and way more likely to choose flexibility over loyalty.

But here’s the catch:
You can’t just slap on a discount or create a “young members” version without risking backlash from the customers who actually keep your business running.

That’s why I loved the concept Vina Robles Vineyards & Winery introduced with their Rookie Club: a monthly one-bottle subscription with text-based updates and social-first events. It's approachable, modern, and built for how younger consumers actually engage.

For one of my clients, we’re experimenting with a fresh alternative—not a club, not a subscription, and definitely not more of the same.

Let’s just say… it leans more social than structured, more seasonal than permanent, and it’s designed to spark connection without disrupting the value of existing memberships.

Because if wineries want to grow loyalty with younger guests, they need to create something that actually fits how they live—and how they buy.

What do you think?
How can wineries build loyalty and buzz among the under-40 crowd without alienating the over 40 crowd?

Nonprofits have to be managed like a business.  The panic today in regard to a “pause” in Federal Funding says more about nonprofit management than government policy. 

Three best practices for nonprofits:

1) Every Nonprofit should have multiple streams of revenue and options to sustain funding their mission.  

2) Every Nonprofit should have at least 3 months of operating funds in reserve.

3) Every Nonprofit should have a CRM containing contact information for potential donors and corporate sponsors to reach out to in times of crisis or opportunity. 

If you have a Board of Directors overseeing the financial health of your nonprofit, you will have most likely done these three things.  If a single source of funding ended tomorrow by either a policy change, a natural disaster or a pandemic, you wouldn’t panic.

📈 7% are open to giving and are actively planning their budgets, timelines, shortlists etc. - so your window of being on that shortlist is now starting to close.

📈 3% are hot to trot.

These figures are based on the ""buyer's pyramid"" - think of it like the 80/20 rule (Pareto Principle).

Understanding that only 10% of your qualified prospects list is actually ready to give now or within your financial year - helps you to determine how long your prospect list needs to be for you to reach your target.

Keeping in touch with prospects - is NOT fundraisers wasting their time on people who are not willing to give.

It is fundraisers investing their time appropriately with people who are not ready YET.

Because - ""not yet"" does not mean ""no"". 

It means, stay in touch - you have a warm prospect who is going to move along the timeline into the ""ready to give now"" bracket.

This is also why you need to retain and trade up your existing donors (new business can be achieved by growing the donors you already have alongside new donors).

A combination of - retention, trading up existing donors, new business and initiating relationships with the ""not ready yet crowd"" - is how you grow a sustainable donor base.

Rhett Ayers Butler,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhettayersbutler?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"How philanthropy can find its future by relinquishing control

800 years ago, Maimonides wrote that the highest form of giving is to make charity itself unnecessary. That wisdom feels newly relevant as wealth and power converge in modern philanthropy. Laurene Powell Jobs recently warned that too often wealth becomes a substitute for participation. “Giving that expects control,” she said, “is anything but generous.” When benefactors decide what matters and who belongs, philanthropy drifts from love of humanity toward a contest for influence.

MacKenzie Scott offered an image of a murmuration of starlings, millions of birds moving as one without a leader. Their direction, she noted, emerges from constant response to one another’s movements. Her metaphor captures what the next evolution of philanthropy might look like—decentralized, adaptive, and animated by trust.

Both women describe a shared transformation. Powell Jobs warns against power disguised as generosity; Scott imagines generosity as shared participation. Each challenges the notion that change flows downward from donor to recipient. Both echo what frontline leaders have long known: real progress happens through proximity, not prescription.

Philanthropy rarely lacks compassion, but its systems remain transactional. Short grant cycles, risk aversion, and a fixation on measurable outcomes shape. Transformation is rarely linear; it unfolds through learning and trust.

Scott’s “seeding by ceding” approach replaces oversight with faith in those closest to the problems. Unrestricted gifts have enabled groups to hire staff, pay fair wages, and rest. Many say that what was strengthened most was not programs, but dignity.

That dignity links all three perspectives. Powell Jobs argues that true generosity builds capacity, not dependency. Scott reminds us that care ripples outward in ways that can’t be counted but are real. And frontline organizers measure success by staying power—the ability to keep showing up.

Seen from that view, the challenge is not to give more but to govern differently. Money alone rarely shifts power; the governance of money does. A more resilient model would treat funding as a relationship, underwriting the unglamorous foundations of endurance and accepting that some efforts will fail in ways that teach.

Scott’s imagery applies here too: each participant adjusting to others in real time. No single actor directs the course, yet the movement coheres. Philanthropy’s future may depend less on innovation than humility—on returning to its original aim, the love of humanity. When funders move from control to accompaniment, they make space for others to lead.

Perhaps real generosity lies less in the power to direct than in the willingness to belong: to a community of exchange where the roles of giver and receiver blur with time, and where the measure of impact is not what it buys but what it builds—a culture of trust and solidarity that outlasts any single fortune."
Urvi Shrimanker,https://in.linkedin.com/in/urvi-shrimanker-infinitgrowthsolutions?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"In the last 3 months, I've audited 50+ LinkedIn profiles for founders across industries.

The results? Eye-opening.

Most founders fall into predictable traps with their LinkedIn presence:

👉 They have professional achievements but amateur presentation
👉 They invest in business operations but neglect personal branding
👉 They know their value but struggle to communicate it effectively

After transforming these profiles, here's what actually moved the needle:

1. Strategic Profile Photos
We replaced casual selfies and cropped group photos with professional headshots that conveyed approachable authority. This single change increased profile visit-to-connection ratios by 35%.

2. Headline Transformation
Generic titles like ""Founder at XYZ Company"" became strategic positioning statements that instantly communicated what they bring to the table. 

For example: ""Helping eCommerce brands increase AOV by 40% | Founder of ConversionBoost | Ex-Shopify""

3. Banner Optimization
This prime real estate is wasted by 90% of founders. We converted these into powerful CTAs with:
🍀 Clear offers
🍀 Specific results
🍀 Ways to connect

The founders who implemented this saw a 27% increase in direct messages.

4. Authentic About Sections
We completely rewrote these sections to balance personal journey with industry expertise—showing both the ""why"" behind their mission and the ""how"" of their solution.
The key was weaving authentic storytelling with clear evidence of capability.

5. Custom Content Strategy
For each founder, we created 60+ industry-specific content ideas tailored to their unique:

👉 Expertise
👉 Target audience
👉 Business objectives

Unlike generic ""thought leadership,"" these strategies focused on connecting with potential clients through problem-solving content.

The results were transformative:
One SaaS founder received 3 partnership offers within weeks
A sustainability consultant was shortlisted for an industry award they didn't apply for
A B2B service provider hired their dream CTO after attracting attention

My biggest takeaway? Most founders try to implement unfocused LinkedIn ""hacks"" without a coherent strategy. They generate views but not sales.
The founders who succeeded focused on strategic positioning first, engagement second.
Your LinkedIn profile isn't just digital wallpaper—it's often the first impression potential clients, investors, and talent have of you and your business."
John Whyte,https://www.linkedin.com/in/drjohnwhyte?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"I have had the opportunity to serve on several nonprofit boards over the years. There's always a period of time -- as is the case currently -- when there is real concern over government funding. That's why it is so important for nonprofits, especiallty those in healthcare, to diversify its revenues streams. Just like businesses, nonprofits need financial resilience to sustain their mission and expand their impact.

Here area few ways nonprofits can diversify revenue streams and create long-term stability:

1. Develop Strategic Partnerships – Collaborate with corporations, foundations, or healthcare organizations to co-develop research, technology, or community programs. These partnerships can lead to sponsorships, grants, and new funding opportunities. Too often, folks want to forge their own path. Now is the time for partnerships. 

2.  Invest in Mission-Aligned Ventures – Consider sustainable investments such as impact funds or health tech startups that align with your mission while generating financial returns. It's key to have a good financial team to help assess opportunity and manage risk. Many nonprofits have started to create such funds, and more need to do so.

3. Expand Subscription or Membership Models – Offer premium content, exclusive research, or advocacy networks for a subscription fee. Organizations that provide unique insights can turn knowledge into a reliable revenue stream.

4. Utilize social media -- This way can be way to find new funders, who may not be familiar with you work.  There is a science to utilizing social media -- you just can't post and think the money will come rolling in.  Invest in a seasoned team who knows how to convert metrics into dollars.

A diversified nonprofit isn’t just more financially stable—it’s better equipped to innovate, adapt, and drive meaningful change.   It is easier said than done -- and it takes time.

Louis Diez,https://www.linkedin.com/in/louisdiez?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"I completely misread a major donor's signals and lost a six-figure gift.

It was humbling. And it transformed my approach to donor relationships.

Here's what happened:

After multiple positive meetings, I was confident our capital campaign proposal aligned perfectly with this donor's interests. The signals seemed clear—enthusiastic questions, facility tour requests, introduction to family members.

I prepared an impressive proposal with all the recognition bells and whistles. I was already mentally spending the gift.

When I made the ask, his response was immediate: ""This isn't what I care about at all.""

He wasn't interested in naming opportunities or recognition. He wanted to fund scholarships for students like himself—first-generation college students from rural communities.

The proposal I'd spent weeks crafting completely missed his core motivation.

What I learned:
- Enthusiasm doesn't always signal alignment
- Assumptions are fundraising poison
- Direct questions about motivations beat clever interpretation
- Donors give from personal values, not organizational priorities

I now ask every donor: ""What aspect of our work matters most to you personally, and why?""

The answer has never led me astray since.

Aaina Chopra✨,https://in.linkedin.com/in/writeraainachopra?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Dear Founder…

Your face is on the pitch deck.
Your name is on the company page.

Your voice online?
Nowhere to be found.

Or worse — it sounds like everyone else.

Generic. Bland. Safe.

And in 2025, safe = dead.

Here's why:
The algorithm doesn't only reward consistency. It rewards authenticity.

Don't believe me?

Think about who YOU follow online.
-People with a strong point of view
-People with a compelling story
-People with hard-earned insights

You follow PEOPLE, not profiles.

But here's the problem:
You've been sold a ""content strategy"" that was never built for leaders like you. Most agencies want to turn you into a content machine.

But that's backward.

> You don't need more content.
> You need a personal brand that actually sounds like YOU.

The real you.

The you that your friends hear when you're excited about your vision over drinks.

The you that keeps investors engaged during tough questions.

The you that makes team members believe in the mission.

That's the difference between founders who blend in and disappear and founders who stand out.

Now, how do you get there?

That's where we come in.

At The Growth Cradle, we've built a different kind of process:

First, We mine your brain for gold through interviews (or deep research if you're crazy busy)

Second, We write stories using insights that ONLY YOU would have — in language that ONLY YOU would use

Third, We create content that's so authentically you, your friends have no doubt about it!

In other words:
While you're busy building your company...
We're busy turning you into a founder people can't help but follow.

If that sounds interesting, DM ""TGC"" and let's talk.

Let's build something the internet can't scroll past.

Because in 2025, the biggest competitive advantage isn't your product.

It's your voice.

Marian Salzman,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariansalzman?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"When I took on my role as Chief Corporate Citizenship Officer at PMI, I set a handful of parameters for myself and my team: 

1. Don’t fall into the trap of arm’s-length checkbook philanthropy: One-off cash infusions can help nonprofits in the immediate term, but they don’t get at the issue of sustainable growth. 

2. Focus, focus, focus: Diffusion is the enemy of progress. There are an endless number of worthy causes and charitable organizations, but our greatest impact will come from identifying a small number of causes that are intrinsically tied to our values and vision and making those causes priorities. (In our case, this is U.S. military veterans, women’s equity and empowerment, and hyperlocal activations.) 

3. Empower—and learn from—those already in the trenches: We’re not going to dictate what happens at the community level. We’re here to listen and learn and find ways to support and expand the good works already underway.  

4. Give a “hand up” instead of a handout: Band-Aid solutions may make us feel good in the short term, but they don’t get to the root problem. The cash infusions we give our community-based partners are meaningful, but their value grows exponentially when paired with our business expertise and insights.  

5. Offer employees a chance to contribute to change: We polled PMI’s U.S. workforce earlier this year about our plans to support military veterans. An astonishing 97 percent of employees raised their hands to get involved. There’s a hunger out there for making a positive difference in local communities and the broader world. Find ways to connect your people to the issues that matter most to them. 

It turns out that this is the way the next generation of philanthropists is thinking about their impact as well. A recent article (I’ll share the link in comments) shares interesting insights into how our younger generations—millennials and Gen Z—are embracing a more comprehensive approach to philanthropy focused on measurable impact and deeper connections. They’re also showing a greater tolerance for the “long game,” willing to take risks in the short term to lay the groundwork for greater gains down the road. 

As the next generation of philanthropists takes the reins and starts investing more than money in the causes they care about, let’s make sure our organizations are prepared to do the same."
