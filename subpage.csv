Olivia Moore,https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliviamoore94?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Generative AI has spawned thousands of new products. But outside of ChatGPT, what are everyday consumers using? What's growing, and what has flattened?

I crunched the numbers to find the top 50 consumer AI web products by monthly global visits - here's my learnings: 

1. Most leading products are built from the “ground up” around generative AI - of the 50 on the list, 80% are brand new as of the past year. Only five are owned by big tech companies (ex. Google, Microsoft), and of the remaining 45, nearly half are bootstrapped!

2. ChatGPT has a massive lead, for now…representing 60% of traffic to the entire list! Character.AI comes in at #2, with ~21% of ChatGPT's traffic. Compared to mainstream consumer products, even the top AI products are fairly small - ChatGPT ranks around the same traffic scale as Reddit, LinkedIn, and Twitch, but far behind Facebook and Instagram. 

3. General assistants (ex. ChatGPT, Bard, Poe) represent almost 70% of traffic, but companionship (ex. Character.AI) and content generation (ex. Midjourney, ElevenLabs) are surging! Model hubs are also a category to watch, with only two companies on the list (Civitai, Hugging Face) but both in the top 10. 

4. While some early winners have emerged, most categories are still up for grabs - with a <2x gap in traffic between the #1 and the #2 leading players. Use case or workflow-specific platforms are also emerging alongside more horizontal players - ex. Leonardo Ai has taken off in image generation for games assets, while Midjourney continues growing as the leading generalist platform. 

5. Acquisition for top products is almost all organic - with the median gen AI company on the list seeing 99% free acquisition! This compares to 52% for the median consumer subscription company before AI. 

Consumers are also showing significant willingness to pay for genAI, with 90% of products monetizing, and at a ~2x higher ARPU than non-AI consumer subscription comparables. 

6. Mobile is still emerging as a platform for AI products - only 15 companies on the list have an app, and just three (PhotoRoom, Speechify, Character.AI) saw >10% of traffic from their app versus website. Given consumers now spend 36 more minutes per day on mobile than desktop, we're excited to see more app-first AI products emerge soon.

Bobby Guelich,https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobby-guelich?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Today's deep dive: AI Clinical Summarization tools 🕵️♀️📚

One of the areas gen AI has immense potential in healthcare is its ability to surface and synthesize information from vast sets of unstructured documents and data.

As Oscar Health cofounder Mario Schlosser puts it: “[LLMs] are uniquely capable at going from unstructured data into structured data, and the other direction.”

So it’s no surprise that distilling information from a wide range of clinical documents and data is one of the most common applications of AI that we’re seeing come to market.

There are MANY use cases for summarization across nearly every dimension of healthcare. To name a few:

↳ Pre-charting
↳ Referral summaries
↳ Discharge summaries
↳ Diagnosis and care gap identification
↳ Quality measurement and improvement
↳ Real world evidence curation
↳ Clinical trial matching
↳ Clinical registry submissions
↳ Clinical documentation improvement (CDI)
↳ Prior authorizations
↳ Legal and insurance use cases – e.g., workers comp, life insurance

Despite their broad applicability, uptake of these solutions has been relatively slow, at least in comparison to ambient scribing solutions.

A big reason is their perceived risk. With summarization, the AI is making a subjective call about what to include and what to leave out. There's also the potential it hallucinates something not present in the underlying information set. In a clinical context, both are major concerns.

Still, between advancements in gen AI capabilities and improvements in risk mitigation techniques, we're seeing more and more organizations begin to evaluate and adopt summarization products, starting with lower risk use cases.

Will be interesting to watch this space in the coming months to see how quickly the pace picks up, particularly for clinical use cases.

Curious to hear what are others seeing.

Kevin Petrie,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinpetrietech?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Data and AI leaders: what GenAI use cases are you piloting/implementing in 2024? Here's my take on the compelling use cases. Notably, some early adopters are tackling multiple use cases at once.

Check out this summary and tell us what you are doing. Also check out our recent Eckerson Group webinar with Intel Corporation, ""The Next Wave of GenAI: Domain-Specific LLMs."" https://lnkd.in/emF95Vaq.

To boost productivity and gain competitive advantage, GenAI adopters are not just using platforms such as ChatGPT from OpenAI or tools such as GitHub Copilot. They also are building language models into proprietary applications and workflows that consume their own domain-specific data. 

Companies implement these domain-specific LMs, which Eckerson Group also calls small language models, in one of three ways. They do this by building an LM from scratch, fine-tuning a pre-trained LM, or enriching prompts.

> Build from scratch. Data science teams design a new LM and train it on their own domain-specific use of language as well as their own facts.

> Fine-tune. They take a pre-trained LM such as Llama or BLOOM and fine-tune it on their domain-specific language and facts. 

> Enrich prompts. They inject domain-specific data into user prompts to ensure the LM gets the facts right.

By getting domain-specific, companies can reduce risks such as hallucinations or mishandling of intellectual property--provided they govern their inputs correctly!

Check out this summary and tell us what you think. Also check out our recent Eckerson Group webinar with Intel Corporation, ""The Next Wave of GenAI: Domain-Specific LLMs."" https://lnkd.in/emF95Vaq

Common use cases focus on customer service, document processing, research, sales, and marketing, as shown in the chart here. Here are early adopters that tackle a few at once. 

> This summer Priceline announced plans for an external chatbot to help customers book travel, as well as internal GenAI tools to help employees develop software and create marketing content. 

> Health providers at MEDITECH use GenAI to summarize patient histories, auto-generate clinical documents, and place orders. 

> Insurance provider Lemonade positions GenAI as a strategic differentiator for the entire business. Its latest letter to shareholders boasts  “we have LLMs trained to answer customer emails, review pet medical records, evaluate satellite and other imagery, read home condition reports, and more.”
