Grant Lee,https://www.linkedin.com/in/grantslee?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"""Is $20/month too much for our product?""

Instead of guessing, we used the Van Westendorp method to find our pricing sweet spot.

4 questions revealed exactly what users would pay (and we haven't touched our pricing since).

Here's the framework any founder can steal:

1. Send a survey to actual users, not prospects

We surveyed people already using Gamma. They understood the real value of our product, not hypothetical value.

Too many founders survey their waitlist or randomly select people who have never used their product. That's like asking someone who's never driven about car prices.

2. Ask these 4 specific questions

- At what price would this be too expensive for you to consider it?
- At what price is it expensive but still delivering value?
- At what price does it feel like a bargain?
- At what price is it so cheap you'd question if it's reliable?

These create bookends for perceived value. You're mapping the entire spectrum of price psychology, not just asking ""what would you pay?""

3. Plot the responses and find where the lines intersect

Graph responses from lots of users. Where ""too expensive"" and ""too cheap"" lines cross: that's your acceptable range. Where ""expensive but fair"" meets ""bargain"": this is your optimal price point.

4. Test within the range, don't just pick the middle

The intersection gives you a range, not a number. We ran pricing experiments within that range to see actual conversion rates. A survey shows willingness to pay; testing reveals actual behavior.

5. Lean towards generous (especially for product-led growth)

We chose to be more generous with AI usage than our ""optimal"" price suggested. Word-of-mouth growth matters more than maximizing initial revenue. Not everything shows up in the numbers.

6. Lock it in and stop tinkering

Once you find the sweet spot through data, stick with it. We haven't changed pricing in 2 years. Every month debating pricing is a month not improving product.

Remember: pricing is a signal, not just a number

Andrew Dobbie,https://uk.linkedin.com/in/andrewdobbie?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Brad Pitt’s new F1 film is a masterclass in how brands can show up in culture.

A $300 million budget. Real F1 tracks. And luxury brands fighting to sponsor a team that doesn’t even exist.

It’s entertainment, sport and marketing all blending together... and it’s re-writing the playbook for how brands embed themselves into culture.

Here’s what makes it stand out:

• A fictional F1 team, APXGP, filmed during real Grand Prix weekends.

• Brad Pitt, trained in a modified F2 car, driving alongside actual F1 drivers.

• Lewis Hamilton co-producing to capture the authentic essence of the racing world.

• Real brands like Mercedes-Benz AG, SharkNinja, IWC Schaffhausen and Tommy Hilfiger actively sponsoring a fictional team.

• Actual drivers, including Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz, making cameo appearances.

• All set for release in cinemas June 2025, followed by streaming on Apple TV+.

This isn’t just clever product placement, it’s narrative integration at its best.

Real brands woven into a fictional story, filmed in real-time at actual events.

And it’s a glimpse of where brand marketing is heading.

The film isn’t even out yet, and here we are talking about the brands already.

That’s how you build long-term equity.

This is the new standard in marketing:

• Culture first, commerce second.
• Stories over traditional advertising.
• Integration, not interruption.

If your brand isn’t part of the stories people care about, good luck buying their attention.

Learn from this. 

Build worlds people want to be part of. 

Create stories they’d miss if they disappeared.

And find ways to turn up in that culture and be part of the narrative. 

Rather than looking for ways to interrupt them.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewdobbie_brad-pitts-new-f1-film-is-a-masterclass-activity-7311680173790146562--RUx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=guest_desktop&utm_content=keyword-landing-page
Vikas Chawla,https://in.linkedin.com/in/vikaschawla?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"This company made ₹576 crore in India by saying no to the biggest e-commerce giants.

This is the story of how UNIQLO, a Japanese clothing giant, chose to swim against the tide-when most global fashion brands in India rushed to list on Amazon or Flipkart, UNIQLO boldly said no to the biggest marketplaces. 

Launched in 2019, UNIQLO earned ₹139 crore in its first year. Fast forward to FY23, they’ve grown 4X, proving their unique strategy works.

Here’s how they did it:

📌They chose to stay off Amazon and Flipkart, focusing on its app and website to control its brand and customer experience.

📌Compared to other fast fashion brands like H&M or Zara, UNIQLO’s products often come with a higher price tag. But they justify it through superior quality, timeless designs, and innovative materials (like HEATTECH and AIRism)

📌While fast fashion giants rely on aggressive sales and discounts, UNIQLO focuses on trust, slow but steady growth, and loyalty. 

From opening in Delhi in 2019 to 15 stores across India today, UNIQLO uses data to expand where it matters, rather than chasing scale. I managed to visit their stores during my trip to Japan and truly amazed at the experience at the store as well comfort of the products.

In a world of marketplaces, UNIQLO is building its own market.

What’s your take? Does this “quality over quantity” approach resonate with today’s consumers?",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vikaschawla_this-company-made-576-crore-in-india-by-activity-7287068882937249792-kD1M?utm_source=share&utm_medium=guest_desktop&utm_content=keyword-landing-page
Antonio Vizcaya Abdo,https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoniovizcaya?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Internal and external drivers of sustainability ROI
🌎 

Sustainability is increasingly recognized as a strategic priority, with clear business drivers influencing internal operations and external market positioning. The ROI of sustainability can be assessed through seven key drivers that connect operational excellence with market expectations, highlighting its role as a value-creation mechanism.

Internally, sustainability supports operational efficiencies and innovation. Streamlining resource use not only reduces costs but also reinforces responsible practices. Purpose-led workplaces improve retention and engagement, contributing to productivity and team cohesion. Ambitious sustainability objectives drive innovation, enabling the development of new products, services, and business models aligned with emerging demands.

Externally, market dynamics and compliance pressures shape sustainability's relevance. Meeting evolving regulatory standards avoids penalties and unlocks incentives. Investors increasingly prioritize ESG metrics, influencing access to capital and valuation potential. Demand for responsible products and services continues to grow, driven by shifts in consumer and client preferences.

Resilience and accountability emerge as critical enablers of sustainability integration. Governance structures that emphasize transparency and data-driven decisions reduce risk exposure and enhance stakeholder trust. Collaboration across value chains ensures stable operations while supporting ethical and sustainable practices. These elements strengthen competitive positioning and safeguard long-term business viability.

Sustainability is no longer a compliance exercise but a strategic framework for navigating complexity and unlocking value. By addressing internal and external drivers holistically, organizations can position themselves to lead in an increasingly interconnected and sustainability-driven global economy.

Alpana Razdan,https://in.linkedin.com/in/alpanarazdaan?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"The teen models in Mango's latest campaign have perfect poses, perfect lighting, and one small detail: they don't exist.

This Spanish fashion giant launched their Sunset Dream collection using entirely AI-generated models across 95 markets. Not a single human model was photographed.

Here's how they did it:

📌 Took photos of real clothes on display stands
📌 Fed these pictures to their AI system
📌 Created model images in minutes
📌 Rolled out everywhere at once

The business impact is massive. Fashion brands typically save 60-80% by leveraging AI photoshoots. Those savings can now fund innovation, better pricing, or faster expansion.

But cost isn't the real story here.

Speed is. While competitors wait weeks for campaign photos, MANGO creates, tests, and launches collections in days. No weather delays. No scheduling conflicts. No reshoots.

This wasn't luck. Since 2018, Mango has built 15 different AI platforms across their business. They've been preparing for this moment.

The result? Their 2024 turnover reached 3.3 billion euros in 2024, growing 7.6% from 2023.

What makes this significant is that Mango proved AI-generated content can drive real sales. Their teen customers embraced these virtual models without hesitation.

Fashion's biggest players are watching. If Mango's approach succeeds long-term, traditional photography could become a thing of the past for e-commerce.

The brands that adapt now will set industry standards. Those that don't might find themselves competing against companies moving at AI speed.

Which fashion tradition do you think AI will disrupt next?",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alpanarazdaan_the-teen-models-in-mangos-latest-campaign-activity-7346765025979584513-i2Vw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=guest_desktop&utm_content=keyword-landing-page
🌏 Shreya Ghodawat Ⓥ 🌱,https://in.linkedin.com/in/shreyaghodawat?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Recent testing on Shein and Temu has confirmed what we’ve long suspected: these “cheap” clothing brands are fraught with toxicity, both literal and ethical.

Fast fashion isn’t a fleeting trend, it’s a festering threat to our health, humanity, and home.

Hazardous chemicals used in the fabrics, unchecked exploitation of workers behind the seams, and environmental degradation that deepens with every discarded garment. It’s a cycle of consumption that poisons our planet, endangers the animals, and compromises our health.

By pumping up toxins, accelerating overproduction, underpaying and exploiting labour, and overlooking their long-term impact for short-term profit. 

Every stitch carries a story of suffering, and every bargain comes at a steep, hidden price that we pay for. 

But as consumers, we hold more power than we realise. Our choices can challenge these exploitative models, champion plantbased alternatives, and change the narrative from convenience to consciousness.

Exploring options like renting and thrifting allows us to enjoy diverse wardrobes without the environmental consequences or health risks. Because sustainable fashion doesn’t mean sacrificing style. 

Brands such as No Nasties, Sui, Okhai, The Summer House, and DOODLAGE in India, along with global names like tentree, Allbirds, and Pact, offer affordable, ethical, skin safe, and unique pieces you would be proud to wear too.

So let’s slow down, speak up, and curate a closet that doesn’t hide harmful skeletons and instead, reflects our values.

Cherie Hu,https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheriehu?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Would you believe me if I told you that the marketing rollout for one of the most commercially successful, critically acclaimed independent albums of 2023 was bankrolled by a file-sharing company?

It's true — and I gave a whole presentation about it. I'm excited to share below the FULL case study I developed for a workshop last year, on the groundbreaking brand partnership between Jungle and WeTransfer for the ""Volcano"" album campaign.

As someone who typically focuses on tech industry trends, this case study was a rare opportunity for me to flex my muscles in marketing strategy. And there was truly no better subject for me than Jungle — who is one of my favorite live acts, and whose ""Volcano"" was my most-streamed album of last year.

An independent release on AWAL, ""Volcano"" currently boasts over 500 million Spotify streams, a Brit Award, and stellar music video choreography that would make even professional dancers envious. What many might not realize is that WeTransfer is credited as a producer on all 14 music videos for the album, as well as the full-length Volcano Motion Picture released in December 2023. WeTransfer timed this partnership with their own rebranding as a company, making Jungle the face of their key feature launches.

The campaign rolled out across multiple platforms over the course of 250+ days, with many exclusive content releases in Jungle's Medallion fan community, as well as on a bespoke, Jungle-branded WeTransfer landing page.

In the deck below, I break down:
🌋 The shape of Volcano's 254-day ""waterfall"" content release strategy, and how WeTransfer's role as a brand partner evolved throughout
🌋 Why WeTransfer and Jungle's brand aesthetics and audiences align
🌋 How the campaign catapulted Jungle's streaming and social media growth
🌋 How the campaign did NOT move the needle on brand awareness for WeTransfer — but still may have succeeded for the company in other ways
🌋 How to use tools like Chartmetric, Semrush, and SocialBlade to benchmark performance of similar campaigns across streaming, social media, and web traffic metrics

Disclaimer: This analysis only covers March–December 2023, so does not include Jungle's recent campaign with Gap, which had an even further impact on Jungle's streaming and social performance.

I *love* doing these data-driven music marketing breakdowns — especially for artists and scenes close to my heart — and would love to help other people out with this work. There's so much insight to be gained, even just from publicly available data.

Jagadeesh J.,https://in.linkedin.com/in/jagadeesh-j?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Searching on Amazon Vs Searching on Google.

""I don't search on Google for the things I can search on Amazon,"" a friend told me recently. 

The reason he gave literally defined what's happening in performance marketing today. 

""When I search for something on Google, I repeatedly see many ads for it and similar items everywhere. 

However, when I do the same on Amazon, I never get repeated ads.

That's why I always prefer searching on Amazon"".

This is so profound that it made me rethink my own browsing behavior.

To understand this better, you need to know two things.

1 ) When you search on Google, you end up going to the brand's direct website.
2) Amazon(even Flipkart) doesn't have Google or Facebook pixels on their site.

I hope you understand the reason.

If not, read on.

The moment you land on a product(D2C) website, Google and Facebook pixels on that website tag you as an in-market audience for that category. 

It will first start showing ads for that brand(remarketing) and then ads for other similar brands(PM campaigns).

This will continue until you move out of the in-market audience segment.

In the case of Amazon, when you search for a product, your information is only available within Amazon. (2)

So, you may see ads inside Amazon but not outside of it.

As a digital marketing person, I shouldn't say this.

But sometimes, it's ok to spill the beans.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jagadeesh-j_searching-on-amazon-vs-searching-on-google-activity-7231495664205979648-zb00?utm_source=share&utm_medium=guest_desktop&utm_content=keyword-landing-page
Lauren Stiebing,https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-stiebing?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"FMCG Giants Built Their Empires on Brand Power. Consumers Today Care More About Value Power.

In the early days of my career, brand loyalty was almost sacred. Consumers gravitated towards names they recognized—trusting them implicitly. But the landscape has shifted dramatically.


→ In 2024, private label sales in the U.S. surged by 3.9%, reaching a record $271 billion, outpacing the 1% growth of national brands.

→ In Europe, private labels now command nearly 40% of FMCG value share and approximately 62% of volume share across major markets like France, Germany, and the UK.

What's Driving This Shift?

→ Economic Pressures: With inflation impacting household budgets, consumers are seeking affordable alternatives without compromising on quality.
Oliver Wyman

→ Enhanced Quality: Modern private labels have evolved, offering products that rival national brands in both taste and performance.
The US Sun

→ Retailer Strategies: Companies like Walmart and Target are investing heavily in their private label lines, introducing brands like Bettergoods and Dealworthy, which have seen sales volumes increase by over 200% in 2024. 
Talk Business & Politics

Implications for FMCG Brands

→ Rethink Value Proposition: It's no longer just about brand recognition. Consumers are evaluating products based on quality, price, and alignment with their values.

→ Innovate Continuously: Stagnation is a risk. Brands must invest in R&D to stay ahead of evolving consumer preferences.

→ Strengthen Retail Partnerships: Collaborating closely with retailers can provide insights into consumer behavior and preferences, enabling brands to adapt more effectively.


The FMCG industry is undergoing a transformation. While brand heritage remains valuable, it's imperative to adapt to the changing dynamics. Emphasizing value, quality, and innovation will be key to staying relevant in this new era.
