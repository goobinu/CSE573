Shipra Madaan,https://in.linkedin.com/in/shipramadaan?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"If you don’t grab a serious opportunity by 46,
there’s a strong chance you’ll be pushed into early retirement by 52.
Not by choice—
but because the system will quietly stop picking your resume.
It’s sad.
It’s unfair.
But it’s very real.

I’ve been in leadership hiring for 25+ years.
And every time I forward a capable, experienced candidate aged 50+,
the response from HR is almost always the same:
“Let’s hold for now.”
“Maybe too senior for the role.”
 No response at all.

Meanwhile, reports say human life expectancy is increasing.
People are living longer, healthier lives.
But strangely, the professional shelf-life hasn’t moved an inch.
Why?

Because we’ve been conditioned to rely on our resumes to open doors.
But after a certain age, your resume alone stops working.
So how do you stay relevant?

If you want to keep getting hired after 50,
you must start building your network like your career depends on it—because it does.

Make people remember your name.
Be present in industry circles, offline and online.
Join forums, write, speak, mentor, and stay visible.
Build relationships where you are seen as a business enabler, not just a job seeker.

Because while HR may pause at your age,
decision-makers won’t—if they know you and trust your value.
This isn’t about being social.
 This is about survival.

The future belongs to those who are known, respected, and remembered.
Don’t wait for your resume to do the talking.
Be in the room. Stay in the game.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shipramadaan_if-you-dont-grab-a-serious-opportunity-by-activity-7354376732776259585-hGGz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=guest_desktop&utm_content=keyword-landing-page
CA Vanshika Giria,https://in.linkedin.com/in/vanshikagiria?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"I wasn’t lazy. I was just distracted.
(And I didn’t even realize it.)

Tasks that should’ve taken 30 minutes dragged on for hours.
Blank screens. Zero motivation. Endless scrolling.

The problem wasn’t Time management.
It was 𝗙𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.

Then one day, I stumbled upon a 𝘔𝘦𝘥𝘪𝘶𝘮 article that listed a few unusual focus hacks.

I tried them. 
Tweaked them to fit my life.
Soon, I started showing up better. With clarity, not chaos.

Here’s what worked for me -
(If focus has been a struggle lately, this might just help.)

1. 𝗚𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗮 𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲
We often chase vague goals — deadlines, KPIs, praise.
But real energy comes when your work feels personal.

One day, I was stuck on a complex analysis. No motivation.
Then I pictured telling my mom what I did at work today.

Her smile. Her pride. That image changed everything.
Suddenly, it wasn’t just a task. It was something to be proud of.

➡ Ask yourself: “Who would I be excited to share this with?”
Picture their face. Then start the work.

2. 𝗢𝗻𝗲 𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗴. 𝗢𝗻 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗽. 𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗶𝘁.
It sounds odd, but looping one instrumental track helps me zone in.
I use Shri Hanuman Chalisa – Instrumental. No lyrics. Just rhythm.

In no time, my brain quiets down.
The repetition becomes an anchor:
“You’re working now. Stay here.”

➡ Pick a calm, lyric-free track. 
Hit repeat. 
Let it ground your attention.

3. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 2-𝗠𝗶𝗻𝘂𝘁𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝗧𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗸
Before starting a task, I set a 2-minute timer.
No typing. No scribbling. 
Just look at the task.

It’s like a warm-up for the brain.
You’re letting your mind settle into the work, not crash-land into it.

➡ Try this tomorrow. 
Just 2 min of stillness before starting.
You’ll be surprised how much smoother the task feels.

4. 𝗜 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁 𝗮 𝗙𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀 𝗚𝗿𝗮𝘃𝗲𝘆𝗮𝗿𝗱 
(𝘆𝗲𝘀, 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆)
Every time I get distracted during work hours, I don’t fight it.
I note it down in my phone’s Notes app.

• An unfinished Udemy course
• A half-watched YouTube video on AI agents
• The novel I abandoned after Chapter 7
• A call I owe to a childhood friend

It’s not about guilt — it’s about awareness.
A quiet system that tells me: 
“This is not urgent. It can wait.”

➡ Create a “Graveyard” note. Every time your mind wanders, log it.
Then return to your core task.

The Result?
I’m still a work in progress.
But I’m sharper. Quieter. Less reactive.

The Biggest Shift?
Not in my schedule, but in how I protect my attention.

REMEMBER -
You don’t need more hours.
You need fewer attention leaks.


P.S. Which of these 4 hacks would you try first?

In the fast-paced world of connectivity, deploying a telecom site (whether 4G or 5G) is a critical part of building reliable networks. From raw land to a fully functional base station, here’s a simplified but complete breakdown of what it takes:

🔹 1. Site Acquisition & Planning
- Identify suitable location based on coverage, capacity, and terrain analysis.
- Conduct Radio Frequency (RF) surveys and line-of-sight studies.
- Acquire land/rooftop rights, community consent, and building/zoning permits.
- Perform environmental and regulatory compliance checks.

🔹 2. Site Survey & Civil Works
- Perform site visits to inspect power access, grounding needs, and structural viability.
- Construct tower or rooftop mounts, equipment shelters, fencing, and earthing systems.
- Ensure backup power: batteries, rectifiers, or generators installed.

🔹 3. Equipment Installation
- Mount antennas, RRUs (Remote Radio Units), and feeders on the tower.
- Install indoor equipment (BBU, transmission, routers) in shelters or cabinets.
- Establish power supply, grounding, and environmental monitoring.

🔹 4. Transmission & Backhaul Setup
- Connect the site to the core network via fibre or microwave links.
- Perform alignment and Line Of Site (LOS) testing for microwave sites.
- Verify data throughput, latency, and failover mechanisms.

🔹 5. Integration & Commissioning
- Load configurations for baseband (eNodeB/gNodeB).
- Align antennas and test signal strength (VSWR, DTF, PIM).
- Integrate site into the core network (EPC or 5GC).
- Run drive tests and optimise KPIs (handover, RSRP, SINR).

🔹 6. Final Acceptance & Handover
- Conduct ATP (Acceptance Test Procedure) with operator/client.
- Finalise documentation: as-built drawings, test reports, and configs.
- Handover to operations team for monitoring and maintenance.

💡 Why This Process Matters
Each step ensures that voice calls connect instantly, data flows smoothly, and apps run seamlessly on every device from rural towns to urban hubs. A single site's reliability affects thousands of users.

Whether you're deploying one site or thousands, precision, compliance, and teamwork define success. 
Let’s continue building the future of connectivity one tower at a time. 🔧📶

Ehmad Zubair,https://pk.linkedin.com/in/ehmad-zubair?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"In 2023, I closed $600K for my agency without a sales team

Here’s how you can do it too

Hint: It's not about motivational quotes and morning routines

1. Less is More

- I focused on only one platform: Upwork.
- I submitted fewer, detailed proposals - Max. 2 per day.
- Every proposal included a video explaining how I’d solve the problem.

Contrary to what most “gurus” will tell you, you don’t need to send 100K emails every month. Focusing on your closing rate will get you more business and peace of mind.

2. Focus on a Niche

- I narrowed down my profile to target only 2 technologies: Django and React.
- I showcased projects with real results, focusing on outcomes, not just technology.
- I declined business outside of my expertise.

You are more likely to be seen as an expert when you work in a focused niche. Do a few things, but do them well!

3. Deliver Value to Existing Customers

- I focused on retaining customers before finding new ones.
- I underpromised and overdelivered.
- I asked my star customers for referrals - it only works if you ask

This led to a 30% yearly increase in business from existing customers. It's easier to sell more to current customers than to find new ones.

4. Do Things That Don’t Scale

- I built close relationships with customers, cared about their hobbies, families, and events.
- I held regular “feedback video calls” with every customer.

Your competition is probably not doing these unscalable things. Doing them shows your customers that you care about them and value them.

5. Measure and Optimize Ruthlessly

- I measured every step in the sales funnel.
- I fixed issues in the sales funnel; numbers don’t lie.
- I asked dropped leads why they didn’t choose us.

Never leave your sales decisions to chance. Even 20 leads can provide enough data to start making informed decisions. Measure everything.

Closing business in an agency is not about volume. It’s about efficiency. The good news is, once you’ve figured out your conversion numbers, it’s easy to hire, train, and replicate with even entry-level employees.

To all the founders and entrepreneurs working without a sales team

Keep going. It's tough, but you can do it

Rudra Karmakar,https://in.linkedin.com/in/rudrakarmakar?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Heads up, Salesforce Admins! 𝗪𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿 '𝟮𝟲 is changing how Flows run, and you need to be ready. 🚨

Big security changes are coming to Salesforce Flow this September. It's all about making sure users have the right permissions before they can run anything. No more free passes!

Here’s the simple breakdown of what’s changing:

1. You Must Now Give Users Specific Permission to Run Flows
𝗕𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲: A hidden setting gave many users a free pass to run Flows.
𝗡𝗼𝘄: You are in control. You must manually give each user or group the ""Run Flows"" permission through their Profile or a Permission Set, just like you would for editing a record or viewing a report.

2. Flows Can No Longer Bypass a User's Permissions
𝗕𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲: A Flow could sometimes edit records or fields that the user themselves didn't have access to, acting like a super-user.
𝗡𝗼𝘄: A Flow must play by the exact same rules as the person who triggered it. If a user can't edit an Account, then any Flow they run won't be able to edit that Account either. It's a strict enforcer of your security rules.

3. The ""Lockdown"" Setting is Automatically Turning On
𝗕𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲: There was an optional setting to ""Restrict Access"" to Flows that many orgs never turned on.
𝗡𝗼𝘄: Salesforce is automatically flipping this switch for everyone. This is the gatekeeper that enforces the new rules. If a user doesn't have the ""Run Flows"" permission, the gate slams shut and the Flow will not run.

What You Should Do NOW:
✅ Audit: Run a report to list all your active Flows. Which ones are critical?
✅ Permission Check: Who actually needs to run each Flow? Map it out.
✅ Test: Log in as a standard user (NOT an admin!) and test your key Flows. You might be surprised what breaks.
✅ Assign: Grant the ""Run Flows"" permission in Permission Sets for the right user groups.

This is a good change for security, but it will break things if you're not prepared. A little work now will save a major headache later!

David Funyi T.,https://cy.linkedin.com/in/david-funyi-t-56360389?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Controlling 10,000 drones with a single computer is a complex task that involves multiple technologies working together to manage communication, coordination, and flight operations effectively. 

Here are some key technologies that can be used to achieve this: 
 
 
Swarm Intelligence: Algorithms inspired by social insects like bees or ants can help coordinate and manage large numbers of drones to work together as a cohesive unit.  
 
Distributed Computing: Leveraging distributed computing allows processing tasks to be shared among drones, reducing the load on a single computer.  
 
Cloud Computing: Using cloud infrastructure can provide the computational power and storage needed to process large amounts of data and commands for the drones.  
 
Real-time Communication Protocols: Efficient protocols, such as MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) or DDS (Data Distribution Service), support low-latency communication between the control system and drones.  
 
Mesh Networking: This network topology enables drones to communicate with each other directly, forwarding data to extend range and reliability.  
 
AI and Machine Learning: AI algorithms can optimize flight paths and decision-making, enhancing the ability to manage large drone swarms.  
 
GPS and GNSS: These systems provide precise location data necessary for coordinating drone movements and ensuring they follow the correct paths.  
 
5G Connectivity: High-speed, low-latency networks like 5G can significantly improve communication between drones and the control computer.  
 
Edge Computing: Processing data on the drones themselves can reduce latency and bandwidth by only sending essential data back to the main control system.  
 
Autonomous Navigation Systems: Technologies such as SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) allow drones to navigate independently, reducing the control load.  
 
Simulation and Digital Twin Technology: These tools help model and plan drone missions effectively, optimizing performance and reducing risks before deployment.   
Integrating these technologies can enable effective management of large drone fleets, allowing for coordinated operations across various applications, from logistics to surveillance.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-funyi-t-56360389_controlling-10000-drones-with-a-single-computer-activity-7283846192084443136-dxDU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=guest_desktop&utm_content=keyword-landing-page
Saumya Singh,https://in.linkedin.com/in/saumya1singh?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Instead of purchasing a luxury car worth 2.1 Crores, I invested the same amount in property.

When I told my parents, that proud smile with teary eyes said it all. Years of effort, and small consistent steps had finally paid off.

I started my career journey by working in my dream product-based company. 

This was only possible because of the sharp domain knowledge + a good resume + a solid portfolio.

Since 2017 I have been exploring a lot of domains, doing small internships, teaching-assistant roles, freelancing, hackathons and what not. 

The truth in our industry is : your resume decides whether a human ever gets to know your story.

I’ve seen hundreds of resumes so far, from freshers, career switchers, and even people with 10+ years of experience.

And surprisingly, most of them fail before they even reach a recruiter because they can’t pass the ATS system. Harsh truth 💔

👉 You can actually check your ATS score (free) here: https://bit.ly/4hk3dGQ

Now if you want a successful career in tech or any competitive field, keep these underrated yet powerful resume tips in mind 👇

📍 Tip 1: Resume ≠ Biodata. It’s a marketing document.

Your resume’s goal isn’t to list everything you’ve done, it’s to convince someone to call you. Write like a storyteller, not a record keeper.

📍 Tip 2: Keywords = Visibility.

Every job description hides keywords (skills, tools, frameworks).
Use those exact terms naturally in your resume.
That’s how you pass the ATS filter and reach a real person.

📍 Tip 3: Numbers build trust.

Don’t say “Worked on improving performance.”
Say “Reduced API response time by 40%.”
Recruiters love data-backed impact.

📍 Tip 4: Tailor for every role.

If a company wants a Frontend Developer - your backend projects shouldn’t dominate the first half of your resume. Reorder and reframe your experience based on the role.

📍 Tip 5: Show evolution.

Add a “Career Highlights” or “Projects” section that shows how you’ve grown over time - it gives your journey context.

📍 Tip 6: Focus on readability.

Stick to one clean font (like Poppins or Open Sans), use consistent spacing, and save as a PDF. Looks professional and works across all systems.

📍 Tip 7: Link your portfolio or GitHub.

A single link showcasing your work says more than ten bullet points.
Make sure it’s updated and well-organized.

📍 Tip 8: Include a 2-line personal brand summary.
Something like :

“Software Engineer passionate about building scalable backend systems and mentoring early-career developers.”

📍 Tip 9: Add action words.

Use words like Built, Improved, Designed, Led, Optimized.
It shows initiative instead of obligation.

📍 Tip 10: Review like a recruiter.

Print it out or read it aloud- does it tell a clear, confident story in under 30 seconds?
If not, simplify.

Your resume is your first impression - Make sure it speaks before you ever do.

Hopefully you get your dream internship, job, project super soon ♥️",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/saumya1singh_instead-of-purchasing-a-luxury-car-worth-activity-7396014995949588480-QwoR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=guest_desktop&utm_content=keyword-landing-page
Farhia N.,https://tz.linkedin.com/in/farhia-n-7a127b263?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"🚨 Why Are So Many African Startups Registered in Delaware, USA?
And why it should concern every African policymaker, entrepreneur, and ecosystem builder.

You’ve seen the headlines:

 “A Kenyan startup just raised $5M!”
But behind the scenes… that “Kenyan” startup is actually a Delaware C-Corp.



📊 In 2022, only 6% of African startups that raised $1M+ were registered in Africa.
The other 94%? Incorporated abroad — mostly in Delaware, USA.

Here’s why — and why it matters:

1️⃣ Investor Preference

Global investors (especially from the U.S. and Europe) want familiarity.
Delaware offers:

Strong investor protections

Clear legal precedents

Easy exits via IPO or acquisition


So African founders are forced to “flip” their companies to Delaware — not by choice, but to survive fundraising.

2️⃣ Legal Infrastructure

Delaware has:

Founder-friendly incorporation

Clean equity tools (stock options, SAFEs)

Simple VC due diligence

African legal systems? Not necessarily weak — just unfamiliar to global capital. And unfamiliar = risky.

3️⃣ Global Ambition

If you're building across Africa or aiming for a global exit, Delaware gives:

A base for raising from multiple jurisdictions

Legal comfort for U.S./EU acquirers

International credibility (on paper)

But here’s the downside:

❌ Capital flight
Millions raised under the name of “African startups” leave the continent immediately.
Offshore accounts. Offshore operations. Local economies see little return.

❌ Tax loss
Parent companies registered abroad often pay no corporate tax in Africa.
This starves local governments and widens inequality.

❌ Ecosystem fragility
Legal, tax, banking, and compliance expertise is built in Delaware, not Dakar.
Africa loses the chance to strengthen its own systems — and remains dependent.

🧠 Hard truth:

We celebrate funding rounds, but ignore the jurisdiction of control.
Africa is exporting its startups before they scale.

🚀 The Way Forward:

Pan-African legal frameworks that offer global-grade investor protections

AfCFTA-backed tech incorporation models

African VCs and sovereign funds that don’t require Delaware flips

Startup ecosystems that advocate for local registration with cross-border reach

💬 Let’s not just raise capital.
Let’s retain it, tax it, and build systems that serve Africans first.

Jussi Salovaara,https://sg.linkedin.com/in/jsalovaara?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"I’ve been watching Japan shift gears, and it’s impossible to ignore.

For a long time, Japan has risen above with process innovation and constant improvements, powering advanced manufacturing and world-class hardware.

But what it often struggled with was turning those deep process understandings and industry insights into revolutionary software or startups that could scale globally.

That narrative is starting to change, and it’s not by accident. It’s the result of a series of positive shifts that are finally aligning in the right direction:

1️⃣ First, there used to be a linguistic barrier that has long held Japanese startups back.

English is becoming more common in professional settings, and the rise of large language models is accelerating the shift.

This may not sound dramatic on its own, but it fundamentally changes the playing field. With this, founders can raise capital, recruit talent, and sell to overseas customers without hitting the same walls they used to face.

2️⃣ Second, the bridge with other ecosystems is maturing.

Japan is linking more deeply with regional ecosystems, moving beyond big corporations establishing strong presence in SEA over the past decade to now having startups from Singapore, Korea and Vietnam pitching and selling into Japan.

We saw this clearly at Antler Japan’s Demo Day in March, where startups from across APAC like fileAI, WhiRik AI Inc., Kubo Care Private Ltd, wrtn technologies, and bootloader studio pitched alongside Japanese founders.

This two-way natural collaboration is proving ground where Japanese startups can test global strategies in diverse markets before scaling further.

3️⃣ Third, there’s a mindset shift.

For decades, Japanese entrepreneurs focused inward, building for a domestic audience that was large enough to sustain growth on its own. But demographic challenges and economic pressures have pushed founders to think differently. 

Today, more Japanese startups are building with a “born global” approach, structuring their go-to-market strategies around regional expansion from the start.

This shift is reinforced by real government pushes and agencies like JETRO - Japan External Trade Organization are actively helping founders adopt a global mindset.

This is particularly exciting for Antler Japan.

With the right support, Japanese startups can now leap from their home market into Southeast Asia and beyond, carrying the rigor and discipline Japan is known for and applying it to a global customer base.

This is just the beginning. Japan’s startups are at an inflection point. Results will depend on execution, cultural shifts, and sustained support from both government and ecosystem players.

The pieces are falling into place, and the next generation of Japanese startups is being pushed into the right direction for global scale, by necessity and by opportunity.

The only question is who will be bold enough to break through the challenges, and fast enough to seize the moment.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jsalovaara_ive-been-watching-japan-shift-gears-and-activity-7370644454019379200-D7mR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=guest_desktop&utm_content=keyword-landing-page
