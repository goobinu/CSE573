Chirag K Baxi,https://in.linkedin.com/in/chirag-k-baxi-726bb047?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Handling corroded steel structures carrying heavy load.

Normally industries prefer steel structure to house their production and infrastructure units. They take less time for fabrication and erection, they are stubborn and strong as compared to concrete structures and they are also convenient for maintenance.

However when they are corroded or start losing their structural parameters, then they are left with couple of options. One is to replace them and another is to rehabilitate them. Replacing them is a convenient option but it calls for stopping all the activities happening over the structure which might be a loss of production for a process industry. It is also a part of depletion of natural resource - metal ore' which must be avoided.

When the option of their rehabilitation is sought, the first and most important activity in this direction is to carry out the actual assessment of damages by non destructive or partial destructive method. These methods are listed below.

1.     Ultrasonic thickness measurement test,
This test measures actual thickness of the section which can be compared with the original thickness and reduction in thickness if any – can be known.

2.     Magnetic particle test,
This test indicates disturbance in micro particles of the metal matrix if any which can again be compared with the original molecular structure of the metal member to arrive at the variance if any.

3.     Microstructure analysis,
Here the metal member is observed under 600x magnification under radioactive source which helps to know the granular structure of the metal member.

4.     Dye Penetration test,
This test highlights crevices and fishers if developed within the metal member.

5.     Themography test,
This is an advance test which indentifies hot zone and cold zone within metal matrix. The thermal representation of test result can be correlated with internal damage of metal member in lamination pattern.

6.     Radiography.
As the name suggests, radioactive waves are passed through metal member to know complete details of internal structure of the metal member. This test can cause radioactive infection so it is done within ‘no man’s land’.

Test results are then to be comprehensively interpreted and evaluated to arrive at the deficiency developed within the metal member. More often than not the help of reverse engineering is taken to quantify the deficiency and actual parameters in which augmentation required to be done. Accordingly the rehabilitation scheme for corroded or under-performing structural steel structure can be designed and executed at site. Pictures of highly corroded / deteriorated structures tell everything about the possible damages.",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chirag-k-baxi-726bb047_handling-corroded-steel-structures-carrying-activity-7090662594344087553-S2Rn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=guest_desktop&utm_content=keyword-landing-page

Shivi Mishra,https://in.linkedin.com/in/shivi-mishra-2218a2223?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"How We Started Bug Management at takeUforward 🚀  

In any budding startup, especially when you're building everything from scratch as a bunch of college students with no prior professional experience, managing user feedback and bugs can be chaotic.  

From day one, we gave our users the option to report bugs while using the website, ensuring a better user experience. But with a growing user base, we soon realized that managing all bug reports and feature requests in one place was becoming overwhelming. Each user had a unique request -> some system-specific bugs, others feature suggestions. As a service provider, resolving these issues was our responsibility because, at the end of the day, ""customer obsession is the only trend that matters"" (though, let’s be real, not every customer is meant to be obsessed with😃).  

🫡 #TheChallenge: Efficiently Assigning & Resolving Bugs  
With a small team divided into problem setters, video editors, developers, editorial writers, and those handling miscellaneous tasks, we needed a seamless way to ensure reported issues reached the right person. Initially, we integrated ClickUp to automate task creation, assignments, and progress updates. But something was missing—users needed a direct way to communicate with us without the formality (and hassle) of email updates!

👾 #TheSolution: An Internal Bug Management Portal  
To streamline everything, I built an internal portal to:  
✅ Monitor reported bugs across different sections  
✅ Filter bugs based on priority & report time  
✅ Track resolution time and last updates  
✅ Allow direct communication with users via comments  

It took me a week of development time to build this (don’t judge the UI—it’s minimal and purely functional for internal use), but the impact has been huge:  
🔹 Bugs in single digits: at any given time  
🔹 Average resolution time: 48-60 hours 
🔹 Every reported issue reaches us directly, and we respond firsthand  

This might seem like a basic operation from a developer's perspective, but for our team, it has transformed the way we handle user feedback. Small internal projects like these don’t just improve efficiency, they enhance user trust and satisfaction.  

Building things fast, iterating faster; that’s the startup way. 🚀",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shivi-mishra-2218a2223_how-we-started-bug-management-at-takeuforward-activity-7311447522210627585-yWr7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=guest_desktop&utm_content=keyword-landing-page

Yuvraj Vardhan,https://in.linkedin.com/in/yuvrajvardhan?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"Automation is more than just clicking a button

While automation tools can simulate human actions, they don't possess human instincts to react to various situations. Understanding the limitations of automation is crucial to avoid blaming the tool for our own scripting shortcomings.

📌 Encountering Unexpected Errors:
Automation tools cannot handle scenarios like intuitively handling error messages or auto-resuming test cases after failure. Testers must investigate execution reports, refer to screenshots or logs, and provide precise instructions to handle unexpected errors effectively.

📌 Test Data Management:
Automation testing relies heavily on test data. Ensuring the availability and accuracy of test data is vital for reliable testing. Testers must consider how the automation script interacts with the test data, whether it retrieves data from databases, files, or APIs. Additionally, generating test data dynamically can enhance test coverage and provide realistic scenarios.

📌 Dynamic Elements and Timing:
Web applications often contain dynamic elements that change over time, such as advertisements or real-time data. Testers need to use techniques like dynamic locators or wait to handle these dynamic elements effectively. Timing issues, such as synchronization problems between application responses and script execution, can also impact test results and require careful consideration.

📌 Maintenance and Adaptability:
Automation scripts need regular maintenance to stay up-to-date with application changes. As the application evolves, UI elements, workflows, or data structures might change, causing scripts to fail. Testers should establish a process for script maintenance and ensure scripts are adaptable to accommodate future changes.

📌 Test Coverage and Risk Assessment:
Automation testing should not aim for 100% test coverage in all scenarios. Testers should perform risk assessments and prioritize critical functionalities or high-risk areas for automation. Balancing automation and manual testing is crucial for achieving comprehensive test coverage.

📌 Test Environment Replication:
Replicating the test environment ensures that the automation scripts run accurately and produce reliable results. Testers should pay attention to factors such as hardware, software versions, configurations, and network conditions to create a robust and representative test environment.

📌 Continuous Integration and Continuous Testing:
Integrating automation testing into a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline can accelerate the software development lifecycle. Automation scripts can be triggered automatically after each code commit, providing faster feedback on the application's stability and quality.

Let's go beyond just clicking a button and embrace automation testing as a strategic tool for software quality and efficiency.

George Ukkuru,https://in.linkedin.com/in/ukkuru?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"How did a vague defect cost us 18+ hours?

Bad bug reports are worse than no reports.

They create chaos, kill time, and stall launches.

I learned this the hard way at a healthcare company.

A blood bank release. High stakes. Time-sensitive.

Then—one vague bug appeared just before launch.

“Form not working. Urgent.”

No steps. No context. No response from the tester.

  
We waited 18 hours for a reply.
 
The entire team was stuck. Discussions went in circles.

 All because one report lacked clarity.

The real issue?

 Poor writing made action impossible.

💡 Want to write reports that help?

Here’s a checklist every defect report should include:

✅ Clear summary – What’s wrong in one line

✅ Steps to reproduce – Easy, exact steps

✅ Expected vs. actual – What should vs. what did
 
✅ Priority & severity – Impact clearly defined
 
✅ Environment – OS, device, version, etc.
  
✅ Screenshots or logs – Show, don’t just tell
 
✅ Component/module – Where it happened
 
✅ Assignee & reporter – Who’s handling what
 
✅ Version/sprint – When it was found
 
✅ Linked issues/comments – Extra context

🚀 Clear bugs lead to faster fixes.
 
💥 Vague bugs? They break your team.

Bharat Varshney,https://in.linkedin.com/in/bharatvarshney?trk=keyword-landing-page_feed-actor-name,"After mentoring 50+ QA professionals and collaborating across cross-functional teams, I’ve noticed a consistent pattern:

 Great testers don’t just find bugs faster — they identify patterns of failure faster.

The biggest bottleneck isn’t just in writing test cases.
 It’s in the 10-15 minutes of uncertainty, thinking: What should I validate here? Which testing approach fits best?

Here’s my Pattern Recognition Framework for QA Testing 

1. Test Strategy Mapping
 Keywords:“new feature”, “undefined requirements”, “early lifecycle”
 Use when feature is still evolving — pair with Product/Dev, define scope, test ideas, and risks collaboratively.

2. Boundary Value & Equivalence Class
 Keywords: “numeric input”, “range validation”, “min/max”, “edge cases”
 Perfect for form fields, data constraints, and business rules. Spot breakpoints before users do.

3. Exploratory Testing
 Keywords: “new flow”, “UI revamp”, “unusual user behavior”, “random crashes”
 Ideal when specs are incomplete or fast feedback is required. Let intuition and product understanding lead.

4. Regression Testing
 Keywords: “old functionality”, “code refactor”, “hotfix deployment”
 Always triggered post-deployment or sprint-end. Automate for stability, manually validate for confidence.

5. API Testing (Contract + Behavior)
 Keywords: “REST API”, “status codes”, “response schema”, “integration bugs”
 Use when backend is decoupled. Postman, Postbot, REST Assured — pick your tool, validate deeply.

6. Performance & Load
 Keywords: “slowness”, “timeout”, “scaling issue”, “traffic spike”
 JMeter, k6, or BlazeMeter — simulate real user load and catch bottlenecks before production does.

7. Automation Feasibility
 Keywords: “repeated scenarios”, “stable UI/API”, “smoke/sanity”
 Use Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, or hybrid frameworks — focus on ROI, not just coverage.

8. Log & Debug Analysis
 Keywords: “not reproducible”, “backend errors”, “intermittent failures”
 Dig into logs, inspect API calls, use browser/network tools — find the hidden patterns others miss.

9. Security Testing Basics
 Keywords: “user data”, “auth issues”, “role-based access”
 Check if roles, tokens, and inputs are secure. Include OWASP mindset even in regular QA sprints.

10. Test Coverage Risk Matrix
 Keywords: “limited time”, “high-risk feature”, “critical path”
 Map test coverage against business risk. Choose wisely — not everything needs to be tested, but the right things must be.

11.Shift-Left Testing (Early Validation)
Keywords: “user stories”, “acceptance criteria”, “BDD”, “grooming phase”
 Get involved from day one. Collaborate with product and devs to prevent defects, not just detect them.

 Why This Matters for QA Leaders?
Faster bug detection = Higher release confidence
Right testing approach = Less flakiness & rework
Pattern recognition = Scalable, proactive QA culture
